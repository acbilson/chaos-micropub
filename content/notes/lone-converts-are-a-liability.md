The mission to share with individuals reflects our cultural value for autonomy, but this is a weakness. To be introduced to Jesus, even to be swayed enough to give some allegiance to Him, then to leave the individual to figure out the rest. Better evangelists follow up with interested folks and may meet with them or take them to a church, but they tend to see their work as complete once the person professes faith in Jesus.

Two branches

First, we shouldn't extract people from their existing networks as requisite for being a Christian
Second, the path towards Jesus is walked together with others, and not simply by attending a church
