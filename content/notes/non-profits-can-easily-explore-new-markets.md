**Non-profit organizations may be an underestimated entrepreneurial incubator.**

Building off my first entrepreneurial insight, the first two of Elkington and Hartigan's models serves another niche in society - the creation of new markets.

New markets are described as 'emerging,' which generates the image of an animal hiding in a dark hole.  One may guess the size or type of the creature from the characteristics of the hole and surroundings, but certainty only comes after it has 'emerged.'  In this way an experienced entrepreneur may make educated guesses about the nature of a potential new market, as a huntsman may know the shape of a fox hole, but will not know for certain until it's been lured into the open.

## Importance - New Market Investigation

The non-profit organization is uniquely fitted for the investigation of new markets.  They operate on the frontiers of marketable business, a place where new markets are more likely to be identified.  Unlike for-profit companies, a lack of profitability does not necessitate a withdrawal from a venture, the continuance of which may spook out additional opportunities.  Like for-profit business, the value of its product or service is not measured simply in customer's remuneration, but ['blended'](www.blendedvalue.org).

## Application - Incubation

Much exploration has been done with entrepreneurial incubators, but perhaps we miss another place where entrepreneurial ventures could be birthed?  What if the local church was mobilized as the hot-bed of entrepreneurship?  Could the frontier efforts of the local church in creative service to the devalued also be place where new profitable enterprise is found?

I do not have a ready answer to these questions, and I suspect examples that incorporate the local church into for-profit enterprise are few.  [Franktuary](www.franktuary.com) (previously known as Hot Dogma), an entrepreneurial venture based in Pittsburgh, PA may offer inspiration.  Founded in 2004, it was started by college students in the basement of Trinity Cathedral.  While their example doesn't stem first from social enterprise-more relevant to this discussion-their partnership with the local church might be replicated.
