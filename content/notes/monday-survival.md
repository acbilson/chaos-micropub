How do we survive Mondays? This is what we endured today:

6:30: Graham and Royal begin crying, "Mama, mama!" I prepare breakfast and get them out of bed (Amie usually does this).


7:00: The boys stop eating and start mess-making. I clean them up and get them down from the table before everything ends up on the floor.


7:30: Amie puts Royal back up to the table because he was still acting hungry and spoon-feeds him cereal.


8:00: The boys are restless. Royal steals a car from Graham, who chases him down and pulls it from his hands. Royal is crying and angry. Some conflict incident happens every five minutes or so. Amie pulls out the bean box to direct Graham's attention. I remark that Royal seems to be particularly edgy this morning, even after eating more breakfast. Amie begins to feel alone and overwhelmed.


9:00: Amie has been trying to get the boys ready to go outside for an hour. She's dressed them both, but attending to Royal's constant demands, mixed in with Graham's, delays every step of the way. Royal dumps dried beans all over the floor. I join a Monday-morning Zoom call, then another that lasts until 10:00.


10:00: Amie stamina is gone, and she's upset. The boys become more subdued, especially Graham, at Amie's outburst and tears. She wants another person to be present and a safe place to take the boys, but I'm absent and there's no one to call. She feels angry that other parents aren't saying how shitty it is to be alone and shame for losing her cool. I stuff my anxiety about losing my job because my performance is affected by a lack of focus and try to figure out how to help without forgetting everything I'm responsible for today. My dual-focus makes empathy impossible, and I'm annoyed because my allergies are stirred up and I'm constantly sniffling or sneezing and my eyes itch.


10:30: I say that we're not alone, only not connected to parents and/or people who are available on Mondays. Amie feels misunderstood by me and abandoned by community. The time to make friends with whom she could share the burden feels like it'll take six months or more, and the risk that the investment won't pay off is really high. I contain Royal while Graham gets his shoes on, and Amie takes the boys to the park.
