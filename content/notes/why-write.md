Habits have been a challenge for me all my life. A new habit develops, sticks, then some life change happens and it gets lost in the transition. Sometimes I restart, but it's a lot of intention-energy and I don't have much to spare. So these are reasons why I want to keep at the writing habit.

## Inspiration

### Don't repeat yourself, write it down and share it

It's part of programmer philosophy to write a function once and share it across the project instead of duplicating it. This same philosophy applies to ideas.

### Writing and reading one's writing connects ideas together, sometimes forming new ideas and connections

There's something innovative when ideas from multiple domains are placed together. I'm fairly certain this is Elon Musk's primary strategy for creating new solutions - find a solution in one domain and apply it to another.
