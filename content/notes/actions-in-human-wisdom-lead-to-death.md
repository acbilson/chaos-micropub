The first time Abram is given a chance to rely upon God's promise instead of his own wisdom, he leaves the promised land and {{< backref src="/bible/abram-sojourns-in-egypt" name="sojourns in egypt" >}}.

Despite the LORD's promise to make him a great nation, Abram leaves the land he'd been promised when a famine makes staying hard. When he approached Egypt, he ignored God's promise to protect his family and used deception to protect himself. He achieved his own protection at the price of Sarai; the very woman through which God was going to fulfill His promise! The explanation that Pharaoh was afflicted because of Sarai, not because of Abram, is both a confirmation of God's promise to protect this human family and a censure of Abram's deception, as though He were saying "Not for your sake, Abram, will I deliver Sarai from Pharaoh's hand, but for the sake of my promise to make you a great nation through her."

There are so many hyperlinks to when {{< backref src="/bible/humanity-disregards-gods-wisdom-for-a-lie" >}}. The use of the word 'seeing.' Deception. Broken relationship. The line, "What is this you have done?"
