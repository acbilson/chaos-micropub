There are at least two flavors of apostle focus in Acts. The first mobilizes the existing faith community towards multiplicative disciple- making. The second catalyzes networks outside the faith community for the same purpose.

Jesus spends most of his life on earth on mission to Israel. He invests in 3-12-72 disciples, equipping them with everything they needed to go and do likewise.

Peter follows his footsteps by staying in Jerusalem and mobilizing fellow Israelites in a disciple-making explosion that expands throughout the region.

Paul sails to Asia Minor and invests in a few disciples that go on to fill all of the region with Jesus and his news.

There is not a strong line between what Peter does and Paul. Both also took up the other's approach. Paul plants in Ephesus for years, and Peter is pivotal in the expansion via Cornelius.
