**Convergence is the first opportunity a cross-cultural entrepreneur is likely to spot.**

Ramen Noodles-who hasn't enjoyed them?  Jokingly referred to as the student's staple diet, they are a fantastic example of entrepreneurial convergence.

Invented in 1958 in Japan, the noodle aquired it's name from the Chinese, Within a decade it had expanded to many of its neighboring countries, to include: China, Korea, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.  There's some diversity represented there, don't you agree?  Another decade and they had expanded into the U.S., Europe, and Latin American markets.  As if that was not enough, another decade and they had even expanded into Eastern Europe and Russia.

This is an example of convergence because, while the noodle is an Asian invention, the need for fast and savory food in bulk is world-wide; especially among college students.  The wide-spread popularity of the ramen noodle has opened many other business ventures; in Chicago alone there are dozens of shops that advertize under the Ramen name (though not necessarily using Maruchan's noodles)([Chicago Eater](http://chicago.eater.com/maps/best-ramen-restaurants-chicago)).

Convergence is important to the cross-cultural entrepreneur because it's likely to be the first opportunity he spots.  Many of the examples we've read in previous books have been examples of convergence, possibly because it's faster to imagine ideas in one's own culture being modified and transplanted to new soil.  Divergence requires understanding another culture at a level which often can't be immediately gained, while one discovers the differences between one's own culture and the culture of the host culture.

Even though convergence is about finding commonalities of need across cultures, it doesn't mean the entrepreneur can port the product as-is.  Maruchan for example has an Americanized website, and its FAQ page answers questions that reflect American concerns (manufacturing, sodium content, the meaning of 'Maruchan').  Had they not adapted their packaging and branding to an American market, it's unlikely they would have been so successful in the American market.

Amie and I have begun eating Ramen noodles on a regular basis since I've begun this MBA.  They're well known as a fast, reasonably healthy (if you don't use the whole flavor package) snacks or whole meals that need only water and a microwave to prepare.  That's perfect for this hectic season of life; they meet our need well.

Thinking about business moving forward, the concepts of convergence and divergence are helpful frameworks to identify value that could be moved across cultural lines.  It's also helpful to recognize some of the pitfalls of the approaches, such as the need for convergent enterprise to change aspects of its delivery for the new cultural context.  And now, a fun fact about Maruchan:

"Maruchan produces 3.6 billion packages of Ramen Noodle Soup a year. If the noodles were all strung together they would reach all the way from earth to the planet Mars and back ([Maruchan](http://www.maruchan.com/ramen-history and http://www.maruchan.com/faqs))."

Wow!
