**Understanding one's own cultural values from the perspective of an outsider helps to accept differences in other cultures.**

So often exposure to other cultures is immediately followed by judgment.  Differences are strange at best, and evil at worst.  For example, when an Anglo, who values personal space, is exposed to an Arab, who values close proximity, there's a tendency to condemn their practice as barbarian, or to pity them (Livermore).

When one considers the values that make up one's own culture; however, this makes it easier to compare another culture without critical judgment.  Read about the high value American's place upon deodorant for example, and you can't help but walk away thinking we're a little odd; even if you like deodorant.

In Chicago the Moxie award goes to the tech company with the best culture ([Built In Chicago](http://www.builtinchicago.org/2016/05/16/2016-moxie-awards-best-company-culture)).  The award winner isn't selected by the employees, it's chosen by a panel of judges.  It's the outside perspective that understands the value of a company culture better than the employees who experience it day-to-day.  The perspective of these judges lends more credence to a company's culture than any voice from within.  Therefore it's important to understand the values of one's company, not only as you've defined them in a core values document, but as they are viewed by outsiders.  In this way you'll gain the clearest insight into the actual culture of your company, and not just how you wish it were.

In my future startup it will be valuable to get feedback from those outside the company.  When hiring workers with different cultural backgrounds than myself, it will also be important to ask them how they view my decisions and values too.  With a little humor, this will help to understand the perspective of my employees, and that of outsiders.  The result will be that I'll understand my own culture better, my company better, and even those who's perspective I seek to understand.
