**Christians in business may expect divine strength and miracles to accompany their work.**

For many Christians there is a level of expectation that God’s presence and power will accompany their church services, evangelistic crusades, or prayer gatherings.  Stories of God’s activity often begin with the words, “At church last Sunday,” or “at last week’s conference.”  But when Monday comes, the average Christian appears to leave their God at home.  When preachers address this disconnect between action and belief, they often exhort Christians to be a light in the darkness by adhering to a standard of moral perfection.  “Do not curse, do not steal, do not gossip” are common refrains around the topic of Christians in the workplace.  But it is rare to hear a preacher exhort their congregants to expect God to give insight for business decisions, courage to take risks, or healing for disabled workers.  The expectation within widely accepted ministries of God’s activity must transition to the workplace, for God is equally invested in His glory shining there as within the four walls of a church building.

This is foundational for Christian entrepreneurs to grasp and anticipate.  While the entrepreneur’s hope of God’s activity remains disconnected from their business venture, they must live a double-life.  To the business world they apologetically give what they must, perhaps reminding themselves “whoever does not work, neither shall he eat” (2 Thess. 3:10).  The left-overs are given for Christian ministry as a meager offering, perhaps with shame they have so little to spare for God.  When a Christian owns the truth God is active in his workplace and among his co-workers, a holistic sense of service to God may form.  Christian entrepreneurs will discover God’s strength and wisdom are available to them in the business world.

This is a topic to which I can relate.  My first years as a Christian were split between competing desires: 1) to serve God faithfully in Christian ministry, usually prayer and evangelism, and 2) to advance in the U.S. military.  The latter desire I suppressed, giving only the bare minimum of my time and effort to ‘the world’ as I considered my work tasks.  Meanwhile I lamented how little time was left for Christian ministry.  Thankfully this double-life has changed considerably.

In my current workplace I make an effort to take two 15-min breaks.  I began doing so because I wished to do something spiritual, such as read the Bible or pray, during those times.  Guilt grew with every day I took my break and could not motivate myself to disconnect from work and focus elsewhere.  For example, I would attempt to stop thinking about the project I was working on, step away for my 15-min break, and begin praying for my wife, family or friends.  In fact, all the things I’d pray for were outside my workplace.  Ultimately I gave up upon the spiritual practice, but I continued to take breaks because time away from my desk often helped me get a new view on the problem I was working on.

Instead of disconnecting from work per-se, I’d like to spend my breaks in dialogue with God about the work I’m doing and the people I’m working with.  Rather than an escape from work to meet with God, I will instead approach my breaks as an opportunity to escape to hear what God has to say about my work.++
