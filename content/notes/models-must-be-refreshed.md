I was in Amman, Jordan at the launch of my MBA program when I first encountered the Business Model Canvas. Bob Goldmann had a revised version that added spiritual and environmental concerns to the canvas.

Not only did Bob manage to make it look more balanced than the original, he also established the necessity for entrepreneurs to customize their business tools to fit their priorities and circumstances. Most business books have a single good principle which can be applied in one's own context given a little modification but would be disasterous if applied as-is.

That was a few years ago, and the world has certainly changed. Matt Webb gives explores how this might affect the Business Model Canvas:

> If I were updating the Business Model Canvas today, I would draw two rings around the entire canvas. The inner ring would be labelled “The state” and the outer ring would be labelled “The planet.” On the left of each: “Taken out.” On the right: “Put back.” - {{< outref src="https://interconnected.org/home/2021/08/18/frameworks" name="We need to revisit old frameworks to cope with the 2020s" >}}.
