Many Christians associate the value of a sacrifice with its cost. An act or decision isn't a _real_ sacrifice unless it's painfully costly. But is that how the Bible treats the word?

The dissonance I've felt equating sacrifice with cost is that it doesn't match the Levitical sacrifices. The LORD's directions about sacrifice seem to prioritize participation and significance over price. Some sacrifices have alternatives for the poor. I have not found a reference to sacrifice as a painful, costly decision anywhere.

Sacrifice does relate to cost, but not as its primary meaning. It happens that there's a cost involved in sacrifice, but that's not the purpose for the sacrifice nor how it might be evaluated.

Thomas Merton has a clarifying definition which restores the purpose of sacrifice to its core of worship.

> A sacrifice is an action which is objectively sacred, primarily of a social character, and what is important is no so much the pain or difficulty attached to it as the meaning, the sacred significance which not only conveys an idea but effects a divine and religious transformation in the worshipper, thus consecrating and uniting him more closely to God ("Life in Christ", pg. 167).
