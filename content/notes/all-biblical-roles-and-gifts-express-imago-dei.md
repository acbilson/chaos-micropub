The three dominant roles in the Hebrew Bible, prophet, priest, and king, are fulfilled in Jesus. I had originally thought because the Hebrew Bible used these roles to point towards Him (which it does), but had not realized that these three roles are subsets of the original Image of God role from Genesis 1. That's so helpful to realize that humans are created to reflect, not only simply one of these roles, but all three combined, and that each demonstrate, albeit incompletely, what we _are_ as Icons of God.

I think the same logic could be applied to the Greek Bible's five-fold ministry: apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Jesus fulfills each of these roles with His disciples and shares these gifts with His Body to fully express the Image of God among the nations. It's interesting that the prophet figure has a direct match with the Hebrew Bible list, but that gift differs from the prophets in the Hebrew Bible (I think), despite having the same name.
