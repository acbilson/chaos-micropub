**The number and quality of leaders in a business depends upon the top leadership.**

Not all leaders operate at the same level of influence.  Those who garner more respect on account of their character and skill operate at a higher level of influence.  The strongest leader draws others of equal or weaker skill and character to themselves like a magnet.  This has a cumulative effect; the strongest leader draws those who respect him, and they draw others, etc.  This creates a pyramid of sorts, where the best leaders are followed by above average leaders, who are followed by average or new leaders.

To retain high-caliber leaders in a business one must possess greater influence than them all.  One must have respectable character, proven skill, and a high level of integrity or any leader who possesses more will either leave or subvert your business.  Therefore the limitation set upon the quality of one's business leadership stems from the quality of upper leadership, both one's self and the c-suite.

Another way to say it is, the higher the level of respect one is given for one's character and skill, the wider the leadership pyramid can become.  To illustrate using a similar diagram (Maxwell, pg. 78), a '3' leader can only develop a small pyramid before running out of cumulative respect.

```
3
2 2
1 1 1 1
```

As the leadership level grows at the top, the potential for more rows increases, which results in more leaders.

```
5
4 4
3 3 3 3
2 2 2 2 2 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

It goes without saying that as an entrepreneur I want to have the highest number.  It's sobering to think say my leadership level sets the bar for the entire business.  However, there is another option.

If I'm unable to retain the leaders required for the business I'm attempting to start, the trouble centers upon me.  It may be weak character or a lack of skill.  If the value of the business extends beyond my leadership capacity, as I hope it will, then I must find another whom I respect to take the leadership role of the business.  I must humble myself to fall underneath the leadership of another and seek the benefit of the entire organization above my CEO position.
