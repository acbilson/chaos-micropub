Elsewhere these are referred to as practices, but we prefer the term 'ritual'. It better matches the concept of family life, like a ritual of prayer before a meal, where practices feels more like individual work. Everyone doesn't hear it this way, but it's helpful for us.

Bridgeport Church breaks their rituals into three headings. These don't encompass everything they've published on the spiritual life, but nearly all.

- Be With Jesus
- Become Like Jesus
- Do What Jesus Did

These notes are taken verbatim from Bridgeport's subsidiary website, {{< outref src="https://practicingtheway.org" name="Practicing the Way">}}, on July 19th, 2021. By collapsing the basic content to one page, I find it easier to review the whole.

The additional rituals which aren't listed under the three headings I've included under "Other". Based on the practice headings, there's some overlap with the three, but not everything. Some of the links actually go to different pages. I presume this is also a work in progress.
