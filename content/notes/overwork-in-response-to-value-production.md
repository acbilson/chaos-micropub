Tim’s [thoughts](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/you-really-dont-need-to-work-so-much) on the breakdown of value production as a source of American overwork are novel. He uses many well-trodden arguments, but I think there’s something to be said for the “arms race” that exists in white collar professions. My work at Relativity met this description; even though we were firmly ensconced as the number one e-discovery software company, serving a community notorious for its reticence to change, we worked like Cold War arms dealers to stay ahead.

The trade analogy was helpful. An engineer is finished when the bridge exists, but software can always be “better.” A tweak here, a change there, perhaps a rewrite in a fancy new language or a conversion to a new delivery model...
