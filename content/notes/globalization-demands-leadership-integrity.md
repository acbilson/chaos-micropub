**The complexity of global economics emphasizes the need for business leaders of character.**

The world of business is rapidly becoming too complex to manage.  The history  of nation-states influence the rise and fall of economies in ways never before connected.  Cabrera and Unruh mention the effect on the European Union's (EU) currency by one of the EU's smallest members ({cabrera-global}, loc. 279).  Might global effects also be surmised from the chaos within Libya or the Syrian civil war?

While Cabrera draws a descriptive net of global leadership so wide he might as well say one must, "bridge every relationship," his focus on the leader's character over credentials is admirable.  With information relevant to one's business balooning to olympic proportions, the leader's response cannot center upon knowing more - there is too much.  He therefore emphasizes the leader's approach to knowledge, action based on that approach, and moral fiber (Cabrera, loc. 360).

It may be I've written a similar insight before, but it's imporance is highlighted in every book I've read - leaders of character is what the business world needs.  The repercussions from scandalous practice by two of world's first multi-national businesses, the East India Company and the Mississipi Company, were felt by kings and merchants alike (Micklethwait, loc. 515).  More recent scandals such as Enron or the Housing Bubble have also had sociopolitical effects.  When a business as inocculous as the manufacture of your blue jeans requires the involvement of nine distinct nations, the web of interlocking effects must befuddle even savvy businessmen (Micklethwait, loc. 211).

Each link in that chain from cotton to jeans is dependent upon a level of moral business practice, not only at the local level, but also at the strategic level.  When more depends upon the network's function as a whole than has ever been realized, it's no surprise business people want integrity at each link along the chain.  And as the authors of *Being Global* argue, there is a need, not only for the links, but also the leaders who oversee the entire chain to exhibit high moral character (Anderson).

In day-to-day life I strive to simplfy complexity.  Sometimes I forget how complex a topic business can be, and the realization of its complexity makes me wonder who could be sufficient for integrated business?  I am encouraged writers on global business struggle to wrap their minds around the challenge.  They call leaders to be people of continual learning, experimentation, and compassion.  And while I know they do not always know from whence the character and boldness comes, I am encouraged that I do - from the Source and Author of Life.  Therefore, any preparation that takes into account the complexity of global economics and necessity of character in leadership must include as a core component time with and meditation upon the person of God in Jesus.  This is my baseline plan for growth in 'being global.'
