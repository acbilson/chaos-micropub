What if it’s true that prayer moves forwards _and_ backwards in time?

Intercessory prayer changes the future.

Direct prayer changes the present.

Emmanuel prayer changes the past.

Madeleine L’Engle’s exploration of spacetime in her Wrinkle in Time series leads to trippy ideas. Like folding space to travel without using time. Or folding time to travel without moving in space. Or prayer that transcends spacetime.
