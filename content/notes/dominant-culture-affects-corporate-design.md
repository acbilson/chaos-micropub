**The idea of the corporation is a seed which grows different flowers in diverse soils, and the wise entrepreneur will ask questions and temper expectations accordingly.**

Ride a rickshaw through any Indian city and you will discover, possibly with fear, 'commute' means something different than back in the United States.  Jump on a subway in London and you'll politely be asked to 'mind the gap'.  The climate of different cultures and their worldview can be drastically different, and this soil can produce new flavors of corporate expression.

When the Germans engineered the company, their culture of education and respect for working class managers made a dramatic impact on the growth of their economic infrastructure (Micklethwait, loc. 1546).  Other European nations have not seen the same rapid growth, such as Italy, whose value of family supersedes their drive to grow massive companies.

Companies in America are laboring to crack the international codes to overseas profitability.  They stive to be culturally sensitive, and there has been some success.  A few companies have re-imagined their product and their culture to fit those of other nations.  However, the number of companies who take no notice of the host country's history of business, whether by ignorance or nationalistic pride, are far more numerous.

Businesses must consider the host nation's view of competition before attempting to push out competitors.  Countries that place the good of the nation over the growth of individual corporations may not appreciate the market-stealing practices of a foreign company, even if they say competition is beneficial.  On the other hand, companies transplanted from an environment where cooperation is common may find their host country harsh and competitive.

I've read before how a company must encourage cultures to express themselves differently in global offices.  Eat McDonalds in America and you'll enjoy a charbroiled burger; in South Korea you might get a bulgogi burger ([McDonalds, Korea](http://www.mcdonalds.co.kr/www/eng/main/main.do)).  But I'd never thought corporations birthed in other countries would be fundamentally different from their inception, or that those differences would have long-term significance.  Questions like, "How is competition viewed in your country and in this industry?" will define the landscape in important ways; ways that questions of etiquette alone will not.  I also realize that expectations of business success will be different: in America it is individual size, but in England it may be prestige, or cooperation in Germany.
