## Healing Prayer

Many people's first introduction to Jesus was news about the people who were healed by him. The leper who approaches Jesus saying that, if he is willing, Jesus can make him clean is a classic example (Mark 1:40-44).

When I see a person in distress because of an illness, I remember that Jesus heals and wonder if he might heal this person. But uncertainty usually takes hold of me. What should I say? What if nothing happens?

While it's not impossible to stroll up and ask if they'd like to be made well (John 5:6), I might find it helpful to share a short story of a time Jesus heals someone. This will help discern the state of the sick person and stir up their faith. Those who are sick sometimes wish to be left alone or have attempted everything, even prayer, and are not open to another attempt. Others long to be made well and would risk any humiliation.
