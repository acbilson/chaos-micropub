**The public's view of business motivations influences their response to social initiatives.**

Due to the concentration of capital, experience and expertise in the corporation, it is uniquely suited to effect positive change among the people it serves.  And so a broad-hearted owner may choose to funnel some of his company's wealth into the common good.  The British-owned Cadbury enriched the town where its factory was built with the construction of parks and the allotment of a garden to every employee (Micklethwait, loc 1407).  Sears established pension plans for its employees (loc 1279).  Even the robber barons undertook to benefit society, and many of our museums and art galleries were developed by large corporations (loc 1293, 1309).  But the public often viewed their contributions with a wary eye because they considered their motivations self-interested.

The socioeconomic landscape of North America has changed dramatically since these first major corporations began to act on social obligations.  More companies than ever have the capital to effect change in their communities, and multinational giants can pressure unjust governments and fund social enterprise across nations. What has not changed; however, is the skeptical reaction of society.

Daniel Thomas at BBC News writes a fascinating article about the efforts of recognized corporate leaders and their social impact.  Multinational Unilever's "Dove Campaign for Real Beauty" combats the distorted womanhood advertisments have marketed with wholesome models.  Heineken reports its marketing campaign to encourage users to drink responsibly has lessened excessive alchohol consumption.  But Starbuck's efforts to promote racial equality were met with mockery and cynicism.  Therefore businesses must be conscious of their communities' perception of business and aware of the way their social decisions will be interpreted.

When I see so much as a discounted rate at a clothing store, my mind runs to suspicion.  "What's in it for them?" I think, even before I determine whether it's a good deal or not.  As I've read about the history of the company and the societal response I am struck that suspicion has followed corporations from their founding.  As an aspiring entrepreneur I recognize my desire to benefit society may be misinterpreted by those I want to help, or by those who gaze on.  I realize my company's place among the community limits the opportunities I may successfully engage in to benefit my community.  As customers of a coffee company whose unofficial mascot is a privileged white hipster reject calls to open racial discussion, I must be mindful of the good I wish to do lest it be misinterpreted.
