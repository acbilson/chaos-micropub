I'm trying to keep the daily office, at least portions set aside by the Anglican Church. There are multiple online sources, but I find [this one](https://www.dailyoffice2019.com/family/) the most useful for its simplified "family" version. This is all inspired by Thomas Merton's references to "little hours" and the "breviary" in _The Seven Storey Mountain_.

The best definition I've discovered for the daily office resides [here](https://www.anglicanbreviary.net/the-divine-office).
