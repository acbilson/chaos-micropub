This is an overarching note that explores the theme of trees and life as they exist from Genesis to Revelation.

Life is another pattern that begins in Genesis with the tree of life. Humans are mapped onto trees throughout the Bible, sometimes as trees of life (that is, those who transfer God's own life) and also trees of knowing good and bad. Life is closely connected with light, such that Jesus can say that he is the light of life (John 8:12), probably because life emminates from the source of life, Yahweh.

# What Bare Trees Tell Us

What does the falling of leaves in the Fall tell us about humanity?

Full of foliage, a tree supplies shade to passers-by. It converts the sun's rays into energy which grows the tree and produces fruit.

When the foliage falls, the bare tree ceases to produce fruit. But now the sun, the source of the tree's life, is visible through its limbs.

This is so like the human experience of desolation. Seasons of life can appear to be barren of fruit. A time of wandering in dry places, of dying to dreams and idols. Yet these seasons, along with causing the tree to dig its roots deep into the soil (a separate point), also shines the source of the tree's life, the power of Yahweh, upon passers-by (but not the tree). Those who are near to the desolate view more than at other times how great is the grace of the LORD.
