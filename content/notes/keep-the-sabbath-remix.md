The first renewed concept of the Sabbath for the present day came from a sermon I'd heard in Turkey from a pastor in Minnesota. He talked about drinking craft beer and cooking dinner for friends because these things brought him joy and rest. He referred to Isaiah 58:13 and called out that the Sabbath isn't only a rule about not working; it's a delight.

> If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and **call the Sabbath a delight** and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly; (_ESV_)

Children have put a sharp edge to our need for one day in seven for rest and delight. We realized with our first that we could easily live in a constant state of emergency. We had an ah-ha moment like Ben describes:

> If something like the Orthodox Sabbath seems impossibly hard, or if you try to keep it but end up breaking it every week - as my Reform Jewish family did - then you should consider that perhaps, despite the propaganda of the palliatives, you are in a permanent state of emergency. (Benquo, [Sabbath as alarm](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HXkpm9b8o964jbQ89/p/p7hW7E3fHF3PDzErk))

We're discovering much about how actions can appear to be restful but are net-negative. I'd like to review Zvi's [hierarchy of the Shabbistic](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HXkpm9b8o964jbQ89/p/ZoCitBiBv97WEWpX5) to glean more insights and perhaps write some of them here.
