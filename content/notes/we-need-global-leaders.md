**There is pressing need for global leaders, for we live in a pivotal moment in world history.**

The effects of globalization have manifested themselves in economies world-wide, and a wave of protectionism threatens in its wake.  American voters have reacted to the loss of jobs caused in part by international trade and the uncertainty of an economy that reacts to forces beyond its borders ([Williams](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class)).  This sentiment is not restrained to America alone; a BBC poll in 2008 estimates "only 5 percent of the global public believes that the economic benefits and burdens of globalization are being shared 'very fairly'" (Cabrera, loc. 2367).  The Britain's exit from the European Union is more evidence a sizeable percentage of the world is uneasy with the changes leaders have effected.

Whichever side one takes, whether for or against free trade, open borders, etc. it will take astute leaders with integrity and a global mindset to lead the people toward a future which will benefit the whole.  On one extreme lies over-insular protectionism and unjust discrimination, on the other anarchy and a sudo-tolerance that ignores important differences.

The corporation is the only entity that transcends national borders, and thus has the most to gain or to lose from national policies in the coming years.  If leaders able to view the world from a multinational perspective dominate the economic landscape, we could enter a new era of economic possibilities.  The multiplication of value caused in part by the union of fifty states could be partially replicated in NAFTA, MEFTA, and/or the EU.  However, if leaders, whether through faulty character or mismanagement fail to demonstrate and navigate through the challenges inherent in close cultural proximity, the gains could be squandered or even reverted to heavy losses.

"The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes" (Disraeli, quoted by Maxwell, pg. 30).  My influence is too little for the pivotal leadership that will steer or shipwreck nations at this hour.  It is in the hands of our parents and grandparents for now.  The issues of global leadership will only accentuate with time; however, and I must "be ready for [my] time when it comes."  Therefore I will observe the decisions of global leaders, and "consider the outcome of their way of life" (Heb. 13:7, ESV). I will learn from our president-elect, from the pastor of the most culturally diverse church in Chicago, and from my CEO of an increasingly multinational business.  And when my time comes, I will be ready.
