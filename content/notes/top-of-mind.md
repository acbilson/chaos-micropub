> So far, what I've done is to organize the multiple ongoing projects so that I can tell at a glance what's left to do. This has been helpful to guide my conversation and questions with Tom our building maintenance man. I also hope it'll enable me to share some of the work with others.

# Site Updates

- Figure out what kind of process would be helpful to review notes for further thinking. If these are primarily to help me innovate through aggregating and networking thought, it would be helpful to periodically _look_ at the whole corpus.

> I had my first noticable success with this by reviewing notes and creating a couple MOCs from common themes. I discovered some business writing which had direct relevance to church forms.

- Add a visualization, like the network tab, that will show relationships by reference/backreference. Inspired by Obsidian.
