Gospel-tract evangelism is a typical example of a single-event approach to sharing one's faith. Get the basics of the message out, maybe ask for a response, and you're done. Case closed.

But is that how you changed your mind about Jesus? Or was it a process of engagement with one or more Christians, the Bible, maybe direct prayer with God, before you took any concrete action that might qualify as a conversion? Or the road that led you to baptism?
