**The counter-cultural lifestyle is an advantage to one’s development of cultural intelligence.**

The navigation of cultural differences is a growing factor in today’s marketplace.  Even cities, which have historically been centers of cultural diversity in America, now see every tier of business diversifying.  Where leaders were once primarily white males, now recognized leaders come in every ethnicity and gender.  Companies have overseas branches, and their business networks reach every nation.

With this diversification comes a clash of cultures.  Some nationalities pride themselves on their direct communication, believing that indirect communication is disingenuous.  Others are horrified at direct communication, certain that one’s honor before others is more important than the task at hand.  When such cultures come together in the marketplace, misunderstandings and ensuing pain are likely to happen.

The person engrained in his own culture is at a disadvantage in this environment.  He has not faced the discomfort of being the outsider.  But the one who doesn’t fit his culture, who has experienced discomfort at being different, and has put forth effort to adapt to the environment has the advantage when interacting with other cultures.

Global diversity has opened the doors to America’s cloistered marketplace, and the ones who could navigate the American business culture are no longer the ones best equipped to handle multi-cultural business.  While some have had to adapt even to American culture, and will do the same with new cultures, those whose life has been uninterrupted by outside cultures have a larger hurtle.

This is important because the Christian lifestyle is increasingly counter to the American lifestyle.  The friction caused by this growing rift can equip the one who does not fit to adapt, not only to one’s host culture, but also abroad.  Therefore, the Christian lifestyle aids a person in navigating cross-cultural environments.

While in Baku, I was confronted by the engrained nature of my cultural expectations.  A native Russian speaker named Zaour and I were getting along on his broken English.  After a bit he said that his English wasn’t very good.  I told him that if he kept practicing he’d get better.  His reaction immediately made me realize my mistake.  I expected that he should learn my language in order to speak with me, but I did not share the same expectation of myself, that I would learn his language in order to speak with him.  Without the language to express it, I was unable to express my apology for assuming he’d bend towards my culture, but in the future I do not want to assume others will change in order to fit my culture.
