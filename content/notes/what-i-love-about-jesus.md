There's so much to love about Jesus. Here's my endlessly growing list of loves, along with curiosities, questions, and otherwise.

## Loves

- He meets us anywhere, anytime because he's in the past, present, and future. Actually there, not just by memory. See {{< backref src="/notes/prayer-transcends-spacetime" >}}
- {{< backref src="/notes/obedience-is-not-jesus-first-priority" >}}
- Jesus has such an unexpected way of fulfilling the roles and gifts. See {{< backref src="/notes/jesus-fulfills-the-roles-and-gifts" >}}.
- Jesus' leadership upends the authority structures the world prefers. Usually a person's authority coincides with distance, but Jesus is the most accessible leader while also being God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth.

## Curiosities

- {{< backref src="/notes/why-was-jesus-angry-at-the-pharisees" >}}
- {{< backref src="/notes/how-does-the-holy-spirit-change-humanity" >}}
- How did Jesus see? His obedience to the Father is "I see what the Father is doing and do the works with him" vs. "The Father has given me wisdom (in the Bible), and I live accordingly."
