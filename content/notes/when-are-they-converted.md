Answers to the question of conversion dictate how we think about numerous theological aspects.

Certain theological systems define conversion at a single point in an individual's life when they were "saved." Identifying this moment is a crucial piece of a person's **testimony**. The moment is marked by inward experience in some traditions, or an outward ritual in others. The authenticity of this moment is sometimes questioned if their lives exhibit little or temporary change. In these cases, the conversion moment is nullified and must happen in order to truly be "saved."

Jesus' treatment of his disciples fits poorly into a moment-of-conversion theology. His only requirement to discipleship is to begin following him about Galilee.
