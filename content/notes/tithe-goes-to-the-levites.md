Everything belongs to the LORD. To eleven of Israel’s tribes, the LORD gives an inheritance of land and its fruits. To the Levite, 10% of the land’s produce is given as an inheritance. The Levite receives no land because his work is not farming, but the tabernacle ministry.

Given that the Levite might pay for upkeep of the instruments needed to fulfill his work, just as a farmer pays for his plow, the 10% is still his inheritance to allocate as he desires.

If this is so, and it’s accurate that this work continues in the form of pastors, worship leaders, missionaries, etc. shouldn’t this group receive the full 10% from their communities?

Is it, therefore, a robbery of this group to assign most of their inheritance to building/rent costs and programs of various kinds, then offer an arbitrary amount, such as the societal median income, to them as a sort of employee paycheck?

> See 2 Chronicles 31 for an illustration of this worked out by King Hezekiah. When there was more than the Levite could use, the king didn’t route it to another need or program; it was stored for the Levite.
