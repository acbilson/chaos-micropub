What gives life meaning?

Is it the fulfillment of our dreams? The result of our vision and the labor to bring that vision to reality? For there is a sense of meaning after a project ends and the results are before me.

Then is it in reflection? With or without a preceding dream, is meaning formed in the review of one's mundane life, when all the highs and lows flatten by distance and the whole is in view? For there is meaning in the review of our son's early pictures and the memories, sweetened by time, which Amie and I share.

Then it is in our sharing? When the stories are cast and recast, forming in the telling a shape to their narrative that explains the purpose of the characters and reshaped by the special perspective of each new listener.
