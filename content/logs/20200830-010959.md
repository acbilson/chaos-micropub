This is the second week our family has implemented a day set apart to cease from the common labors of life and to embrace all the good which God has bestowed. In other words, the Sabbath.

From this morning until now I have been in physical, emotional and mental agony. I woke with a splitting headache and full body aches, twice snapped at my son, and been in a mental fog that even a two hour nap didnâ€™t clear. The curse broke almost exactly at sundown; the end of the day.

Coincidence? I think not.
