I had first heard about {{< outref name="OBS Studio" src="https://obsproject.com/" >}} from Scott Hanselman a few months back, but I guessed it'd have a learning curve if I didn't already understand video and audio editing. Turns out, it's simple enough that I could make a video in 15 minutes!

Don't let the lack of screenshots deter you from checking it out. I think I'll try it for a bible study soon, and for my September family update.
