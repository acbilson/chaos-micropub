This bout of sickness may be the longest we've had yet. I've been sick now for nine days and have taken four sick days from work. Most nights I'm up multiple times with my coughing or Royal's; last night for two hours between 0000 and 0200. Royal was finally getting better, then on Wednesday he spiked a fever and appears to have a second viral infection. Graham and Amie are doing well enough, but not 100%. We keep getting a little hope, then it's crushed the day after. When will this end?!
