My first unoffice hours today was so joyful. My mom scheduled our call today literally minutes after the invite had been sent. It's a sunny day and there's not much traffic, so I walked around the neighborhood while we spoke on the phone.

You won't find a more tenacious woman than my mom. I may get my great hair from my dad (thanks Dad ;) ), but my endurance and my children's endurance is her gift to us. My gratitude for her grows with every year I raise my boys as I reflect how impossible a task it'd be to raise them without Amie.
