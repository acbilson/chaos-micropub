At long last, everyone's _mostly_ healthy!

The worst streak was Royal. He drank pond scum a couple Sundays back and hardly slept that night. As the week progressed, he became worse. Intermittent fever, constant crying, and unable to sleep without being held. On Friday I took him to the Immediate Care - a double ear infection and croup!

Graham's had a dry cough for even longer. It started with three days of coughing and boogers, but the cough hung on for weeks. When Graham has boogers he'll randomly stop and wail about them. Like a storm siren.
