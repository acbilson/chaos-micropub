It’s been one stress event after the next for the last twelve hours!

First, Amie and I had a two-hour discussion last night about a Congressional Oversight Committee’s published findings on {{< outref name="toxic metals in baby food" src="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-02-04%20ECP%20Baby%20Food%20Staff%20Report.pdf" >}}.

Then, ambiguous results about the mold content of our bathroom came in this morning.

Then, a board member asked for an update and further action with a repeatedly broken common dryer.

Then, I started on a customer ticket at work and forgot a morning meeting. In the meeting there was heated discussion about the project deadline and content which needed swift attention.

Then, I was asked to offer an estimate on another work project.

I’ve systematically worked my way through most of this, with priority on work, but it’s taken me from 7:00 - 13:00! The bulk of that time has been spent carefully communicating with those involved to reconcile and set expectations. It’s invigorating to do the work; only it’s a rubber-band-snap swing from the quiet coding days of the last week and a half. Yeehaw!
