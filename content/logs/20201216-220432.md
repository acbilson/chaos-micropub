I'm thankful for folks like {{< outref name="Simon Collison" src="https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground" >}}, who dream about what the web might have been and could yet be. I resonate with the garden analogy and am, yet again, inspired to put some of what precious time I have into my own little self-expression in this corner of the web.
