I've written hundreds of business insights, but few are polished for the web. I've started to migrate them to notes so I can at least reference them more easily and _slowly_, possibly, transform them into a worthwhile resource. You could start with {{< outref name="Entrepreneurial Insights" src="https://alexbilson.dev/notes/entrepreneurial-business-insights/) until I finish the task and create a master insights post (it could be awhile" >}}.
