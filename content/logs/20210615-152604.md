Last weekend Amie and I hosted a board game night for our upstairs neighbors, Maya and Mo! They brought a couple expansions to Dominion, a deck-building card game, and we had a blast. Amie crushed us the first round; particularly remarkable since neither of us had any experience with the expansion cards. We played a second round then decided to try one of the games we'd offered: Robo Rally. It's a board game where you program robots to drive through checkpoints. Lots of laughter.

It was wonderful to get to know some new neighbors, and I look forward to future game nights with them after our vacation!
