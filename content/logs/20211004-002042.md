Last night the tenant above us held a bachelor's party. The music was loud enough at 11:00 pm that we could understand it from our living room below.

At 1:00 am he knocked loudly on our kitchen window to ask that I let him inside the building because he'd forgotten his key. At 1:45 he again knocked loudly to let him inside a second time.

He works night shift at St. Francis. It's not like him to host a crazy party, so I don't think he'll do it again. He apologized this morning.

I've been exhausted all day, and annoyed that, after a restful Saturday, I'm going into the week tired (again). There's not space to recover from these setbacks, so it may be until next weekend before I feel more rested. Ugh.
