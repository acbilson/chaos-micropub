This week has been _insane_.

Since Tuesday I've worked nine or more hours a day, releasing new code almost every night to resolve critical issues with our software. Today I was indirectly threatened with being laid off if any other problems arose. Mayhem.

If it were my boss making those kind of threats, it'd be time to start looking for another company. But it's not. It's a firm partner, and the IT department has little recourse. My boss and his boss have been exceedingly reasonable; stressing the criticality of these issues without making threats or falling into the blame game. I'm grateful to work with them.

It's tempting to stage a walk-out. If our team continues to receive this treatment, I might succumb to the temptation. How many developers have to leave before someone realizes that it's not okay to treat people this way?

Anyways, don't make any decisions at the end of a grueling week. That's my motto.
