We've been sick for weeks now. First Graham and Royal, which entailed waking multiple times a night and rising for the day between 5:00 and 6:30. Then Amie and I. Currently I've lost my voice, have fatigue, a wretched cough, and congestion since Thursday. Today is the second day I've taken sick time from work to recover. I've slept all night and through half the day. At least being sick at different times that'll the boys has made their care easier.
