We've been in such a fast-paced season, for so long, that I wonder if I've become addicted to the rush. I don't ache for solitude as I once did. Silence has become more uncomfortable than before. It would be nice to separate myself for a time, to rest and remember that the world does not require me nearly so much as I may grow to believe.
