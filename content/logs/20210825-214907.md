Royal has been putting random stuff off the ground for months now. We figured he'd outgrow the habit, but it's not looking promising. Now it's part of his mode of independent resistance. But I got him today, he he.

He popped a dry pinto bean in his mouth and looked over at me with gleeful defiance. Usually, I'd tell him to take it out. But this time he chomped down on it and split the bean in two. So I told him to eat it.

At first he must have misheard, so he popped the pieces out and handed them to me. But I pushed them back and said, "nope, if you're going to put them in your mouth, _you_ eat them." This seemed to puzzle him, bit I kept at it. After a few tries he was making faces (it must not have tasted good), but he kept popping it back in when I said, "finish it up."

Here's hoping he'll think twice before popping another bean!
