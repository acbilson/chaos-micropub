Long ago, I had included a cloud of every post tag with a line connecting multiple tags in the same posts. I've finally gotten around to re-writing the tag parser from PowerShell to Go. Check the results {{< outref name="here" src="https://alexbilson.dev/network/" >}}!

Switching from PowerShell to Go let me build the command binary and load it into my Docker container with a minimum of fuss and a small image size. I was pleasantly surprised how easily I was able to create a Go project for the first time. I might have to consider it for future projects...
