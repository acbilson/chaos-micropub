It’s another Sabbath day! While there are always ways to improve, I’m happy that our family has found a rhythm that often leads to rest. This is how the day usually goes:

Sabbath starts the night before, at supper. We may squeeze in a few chores after dinner to ensure the next day’s rest. Then we enjoy a special dessert or drink, recently a slice of pie. We may have Kati Ray over for conversation or games, or we might watch a movie. Last night we watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.

Graham and Royal have sporadic nights of good sleep, but rarely on Sabbath night. So Amie may catch a short nap if I get up to feed and clothe our kids. Sometimes Amie will get up early and I’ll sleep in.

When all are fed and dressed, Graham and I head outside. We have an established process: 1) walk or ride a bike to the coffee shop. 2) pick out special juice and maybe a snack and get coffee for Amie and I. 3) walk to the train station and wait for the train to pass. 4) walk to the fire station. 5) walk home. 6) drag feet at the last block.

I’m ready to rest when we get back, so I’ll sit down while the kids play (like I’m doing now as I write this). The we wait for lunch and naptime. Graham will watch a show, usually Stinky and Dirty, while Amie and I veg out. When Royal is awake from his nap, we may all go outside or do something special together. This is usually spontaneous, like jumping in the car to walk along the beachfront.

If we didn’t have dinner plans, we may pick up food on the way home. If Kati Ray hasn’t joined us earlier, we may share dinner together. Or she may drop by for an hour or two to play and snuggle  with Royal. For Graham, Sabbath means outdoors, special snacks, and cartoons - for Royal, it’s Kati-time.
