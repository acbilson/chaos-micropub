I’ve overworked this week. When I overwork, pessimism overcomes my thoughts. But here are a couple ways I’m grateful:

1. Graham and Royal are almost constant sources of joy. Whether it’s the way Graham tilts his head when he negotiates for another peach, or the full-body smile Royal gives every time we help him stand, they both are generally happy and healthy boys.

2. My work fits me. I’ve been at Performance Trust for a month now, and there’s so much about it that fits my skills and personality. Equally great, my colleagues are some of the most balanced, thoughtful, caring people I’ve met. Chats with my manager have been a stark difference from previous relationships. I had no idea how scarred I have become by my other experiences, but it’s more clear to me in contrast.
