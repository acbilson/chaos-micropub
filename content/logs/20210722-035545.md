Amie and I enjoyed a lovely evening of prayer and pie with the Ellos tonight. All of us are seeking to be quiet and listen for the Father's voice as we ponder next steps for our families in this tumultuous season.

For the Ellos, we heard integration, provision and home. May the Father unite the Ello's many gifts and passions to breathtaking display of God's character. May the Father supply all their needs without fretting, as the birds have their needs met without harvest labor. And may the Father go before them to establish a home in which they may rest and bear much fruit.

For us, we heard passion, influence and celebration. Like fallen green leaves which turn brown and dry, our ambitions and longings have been silent and seemingly dead. But a fire begins to smoke in the leaves, and the blaze will be momentous when it catches. Amie is dancing with joy, a band of jewels upon her ankle.
