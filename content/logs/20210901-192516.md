{{< outref name="The Tail End" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" >}} is a sobering post I discovered while perusing Matthew Kudija's reading notes, specifically {{< outref name="this book" src="https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2021-06-01-How-to-Talk-About-Books-You-Haven't-Read.html" >}}. It'd be worth creating a few of my own graphics to represent what's left on my timeline.
