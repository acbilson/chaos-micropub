What's it like to hear the voice of God? This is a life-long question that's so helpful to have the wisdom of those who've been listening long. Brother Vryhof has many insights; these are the most helpful to me today.

It's been my experience that, the longer I follow Jesus, the more partnership we have together. In the beginning I treated God primarily as an authority figure. I listened for my orders and moved when I got them. He has weaned me from this reliance on certain direction in the prevailing years, instead pushing me to a regular practice of listening and planning that blurs the lines between what parts are my contribution and what are the Lord's. Instead of a dramatic event, followed by a change in direction, He's slowly molding my heart towards a direction that's still wreathed in mist. Perhaps because, were the mist to dissipate, I would be frozen in my fear and uncertainty. For it does seem that the Lord's plans far exceed what I believe myself to be capable of.
