 Amie and I started a docuseries about the 90's Chicago Bulls called "{{< outref name="The Last Dance" src="https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144" >}}." I have faint memories of the buzz around Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippin, and Dennis Rodman as a child, but now I can finally begin to appreciate what they did for Chicago and basketball.
