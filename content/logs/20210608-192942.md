Inspired by Maggie's {{< outref name="digital garden directory" src="https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners/" >}} and the ideals represented by this eclectic group of digital gardeners, I have made a separation between {{< outref name="Evergreen notes" src="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C" >}} and family logs. I've also bucketed posts by type rather than category which may help visitors find what they're looking for without reference to categories. This is a significant update and, while I've attempted to redirect every broken link to its new home, I may have missed a few.

Welcome to my newly planted digital garden.
