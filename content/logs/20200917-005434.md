I’m torn about a book purchase. I want this Bible commentary series because I hope it will spur me in to continue my study of the Bible’s story and because I believe it’s worthwhile to be an amateur Bible scholar even if I don’t have a teaching gift. My practical sense questions whether the first ever happens from a purchase (no) and whether I need another purchase when I have three books already lined up. When an impulse buy is before me, I usually say no. What to do?
