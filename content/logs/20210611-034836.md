I attended the 20's and 30's gathering at the Evanston Vineyard tonight. We ate Pita Inn and got to know one another. 

I met Andrew Teague (spelling?). He's a college student who enjoys comic books and video games and wants to try doing User Experience (UX) design. His older brother was also at the event. His father is probably Jim Teague.

Anna Herning is taking a year after graduation to serve in Palestine. She volunteers at a church summer camp and is going to Mafraq. Her older sister Sarah was present and just back from nine days at a wilderness campin the UP.

Amanda White is a schoolteacher of five years. She's traveled to Spain and Brazil teaching English for three of them. Her father is a retired spec ops colonel, and her younger brother is studying pediatric medicine. She cares deeply about her students having cross-cultural encounters and forming relationships outside their home networks.

After we finished eating and chatting, we sat in a circle for prayer. Anosh led us in ten minutes of worship. Adama said the Spirit was on me, Paul (my left) and Amanda (my right). When he prayed for me my hands filled with something heavy. I went to pray for Derek but was led by Ted back to Amanda. We prayed for her for a while and gave prophetic words. Jess Sales prompted me to share, and I had seen bones being cleaned by a swirling sandstorm. I prayed for the Spirit to expose the true Amanda, the one He had formed from ages past, the Amanda with foundation. Adama asked me to pray that three times. My hands eventually emptied and, when we finished praying for Amanda, I went straight home.
