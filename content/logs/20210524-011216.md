A prayer from Graham's godparents the Beans on his third birthday:

ðŸŽ‰HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR GRAHAMY BOY ðŸŽŠ (a nighttime blessing from your GodBeans:) We hope you've had a sweet celebration day full of joy and the hope that you bring, giggles and tasty things. May God bless you every day, shine his loving face on yours. May you find kind playmates, clean puddles to splash, lots of laughs with your Royal brother. May sleep bless you both every night and nap-time. May the force be with you in your fourth year, holiness abound and surround you, the Spirit known as a gentle guide. May you hold peace close on all your adventures, snuggle your mum and dad, know they are behind you and before you with every step. And the Maker of the Stars watching over them. May you knit together ever closer as a fam, even as you take more steps and wander farther and braver and with more strength. We're all rooting for your joy in prayer, eager to see you grow as you bloom and blossom.

So happy birthday sleep dear boy. May you awake in peace, remember your dreams where you get God hugs and move forward with courage in the world. You are loved ðŸ’•ðŸ’žðŸ’•
