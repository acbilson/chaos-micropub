In the spirit of intentional change, what if I implemented {{< outref src="http://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours" name="unoffice hours" >}}? My purpose is three-fold.

First, for years my family has stated that they never know when to call. That's partially true; a full-time job, two young children, and my human need for rest absorb nearly every waking moment. When the responsibility to contact family is entirely in my hands, however, no one's happy because I (almost) never think about it. Maybe office hours would make those free times explicit?

An added bonus to family office hours is that it's equal for any family member. I don't need to somehow balance my time between folks - anyone can see how often I'm speaking with the whole squad and can sign up at the next available opening, even if it's three months hence.

Second, I miss friends of old. Every time I speak with an old friend, even for a short period, I walk away grateful and energized. I've had some success keeping streaks by scheduling the next call before the current one ends, but multiple reschedules break the streak. I've come to accept that I can't maintain monthly calls with everyone I love, but I might connect with more folks if I kept office hours?

Third, there's a vast network of people I've not met. How awesome it'd be to make some new acquaintances, colleagues - even friends. I'm a technology consultant by trade and passion, and the hope that office hours might open new doors to work together is motivation enough.

I suppose {{< outref src="https://calendly.com/" name="Calendly" >}} will have to do, but I'd love to host my own solution. Suggestions?

(republished because it doesn't fit in my notes but I didn't want to lose the thought)
