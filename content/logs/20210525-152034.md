After a review of my existing tags, I wonder if it'd be better to create two tag groups to make it more {{< outref name="zettelkasten" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten" >}}. The first would describe content and would remain a tag. The second would describe type.

For example, a comment might have tags `software,python` but it would have type `recommendation`.

Alternatively, I could re-work the category system. Decisions, decisions...
