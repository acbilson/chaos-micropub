On the wise advice of my wife I took last Wednesday off. After dropping Graham at school, I spent the first half of the day at the Botanic Gardens. In three hours I slowly toured the entire place, stopping to rest in the evergreen section and the Japanese gardens. The evergreens and birdsong reminded me of camping in the Colorado mountains, and the Japanese gardens were calm and peaceful. I watched a family of geese on the Island of Everlasting Happiness for a long time. Around noon I ate a salad at the cafe, then walked back to a secluded spot and napped under a tree.

I'm full of gratitude for Nick's understanding about breaks. He encouraged me to take a day off when I was feeling like I shouldn't because we'll be on a two-week vacation in late June. And for Amie's encouragement to take the alone time when my inclination is to stay home in case I'm needed.
