When I get a little spare time, I want to finish a bare-bones Flask MicroPub server to generate Hugo content from any provider that uses the MicroPub spec, like {{< outref name="Indigenous" src="https://indieweb.org/Indigenous) or Quill. With the help of those who've gone before, the only remaining work is to 1) transform the content into a Markdown file and 2" >}} wrap the server in a service layer.
