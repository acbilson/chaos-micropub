As though we had enough, Amie's taking Royal to the ER.

Why, you ask? He shoved a black bean up his nose. ðŸ™„

Amie was able to get right in without a wait. But while Royal was happily playing in the ER bay, the bean fell out!

The doctor looked him over anyways and remarked how well-behaved Royal was, even when the doctor was looking up his nose. Only we know the truth...
