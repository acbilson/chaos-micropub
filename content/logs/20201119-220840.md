Today a 31-year-old Black woman died of COVID just west of Hyde Park. As I took in this sad news, I wondered if Black and Latino Americans are more heavily affected than White Americans. This is what I found:

{{< caption caption="covid deaths by race" src="/logs/data/covid/cook_covid_deaths_by_race.svg" >}}

As of today, White Americans between the ages of 40-100 have died of COVID in Cook County in greater numbers than any other race.

It's worth noting, however, that the tables turn for those younger than 40:

{{< caption caption="covid deaths by race, below 40" src="/logs/data/covid/cook_covid_deaths_by_race_young.svg" >}}

To verify, here's the SQL query:

{{< highlight sql >}}
select
  count(*) as 'count',
  age,
  case
    when latino = 1 then ' Latino'
    else race
  end as 'race'
from
  medical_examiner_case_archive__covid19_related_deaths
where
  age between 40 and 100
  and race not in ('', 'Other', 'Unknown')
group by
  race,
  latino,
  age
{{< / highlight >}}

Where do I get this data? See {{< outref name="this post" src="/posts/data-journalism" >}}.
