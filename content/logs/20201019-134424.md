I so appreciate {{< outref name="Blue Collar Praise" src="https://open.spotify.com/track/0Rtj0nSbKhgyhSDsMgUF2z" >}} from Common Hymnal. What endurance it takes to care for two small kids, work a full-time job, and keep the hope of spiritual revolution alive.


```
We dream of you on city streets,
 breathing again on our bones.
We dream of you at kitchen sinks,
  your glory filling our homes.

 We are not beasts of burden,
  we are children of grace.
 And the blue in our collars,
  is a garment of praise.
```

YES!!!
