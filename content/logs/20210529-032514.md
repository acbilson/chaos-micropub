It never occurred to me before that WebMention technology might be used to communicate between pages on my own site and not only others. But it is a bi-directional link; a feature I'd love for my own site.

Now I have good motivation to implement WebMentions. I'll keep the static vibe by running a WebMention aggregation post-build, then will read them onto the site just like Remark42 does with comments.
