I've been wondering if an IRC channel would be a suitable way to enable real-time conversation with family and friends on the subjects I write about. Comments have been a bonus, but maybe it could be more? I've been enjoying a foray into Discord groups and wonder if a similar platform would be a useful addition. What do you think?
