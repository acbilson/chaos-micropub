Last night Amie noticed that the 2008 Toyota Highlander we'd been waiting a week for had become available. I called after work to verify and schedule a trade-in appraisal, then drove over to Elgin Toyota.

As I left the city behind for trees, meadows, lakes and fields of the outer suburbs, the stress of the purchase melted away. The environment was a factor, but Amie and Graham were praying. I was ready to walk away if we couldn't negotiate a cash payment in our price range.

Ali was courteous and direct. He didn't try to sell me anything more than I was there to buy. I took a test-drive of the Toyota and was grateful to find that it more than met our expectations.

I knew the number I was offering was more than fair, so the negotiation didn't last long. Ali's manager did manage to get me to concede $250. My negotiation skills could use sharpening, but I'm not disappointed.

Oh how giddy I was with relief and excitement when my offer was accepted! The paperwork took another couple hours but I drove away with the car we wanted and left our 2013 Hyundai Elantra in good hands.

As I drove home, I reflected on the favor of Yahweh in the entire process. His favor as Amie searched for a reliable vehicle for our growing family, and how she landed on one that met every criteria. His favor in the dealership and the salesperson. His favor in the financial and schedule freedom to walk away if the negotiation was sour, and His favor when both parties went away happy. It's like His favor towards Abram who, whether in the land of God's promise or in the foreign land of Egypt, was always multiplied under Yahweh's covenant protection. May the name of Yahweh be exalted forever!

Goodbye old friend, you were a great vehicle for our needs!
