I've recently finished Derrick Bell's short story series, _Faces At The Bottom Of The Well_. He was a civil rights lawyer who lived between 1930-2011, taught at Harvard Law, and wrote some of the most thought-provoking ideas about race in America I've encountered yet. The series ends with _The Space Traders_, Bell's most famous short story.

Curious to see if economic conditions have improved since Bell's writing, I looked it up on Pew Research Center and found {{< outref name="6 Facts About Economic Inequality" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/" >}}. Looks as bad and worse than, yikes.
