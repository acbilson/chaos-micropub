A story from yesterday:

In the morning, Graham came looking for Amie to tell her there was dog poop on the kitchen floor. Confused, Amie came over to look. Sure enough there lay a big turd, half-squished, in the center of the kitchen floor. She shrieked in horror.

The source was verified when we found the rest of the poo on Royal's left foot. It must have fallen out of his diaper. Who knows how many places Royal's foot trod between Graham's discovery and his apprehension?

Graham maintains that it was _dog poop_. He's in denial, poor guy.
