I've added a new feature to the site, backlink previews!

What if you could see, not only to what places an article pointed, but also what other articles pointed to the current one? And what if, instead of opening an article from either direction, you could preview a snippet of its contents? That's what {{< backref src="/notes/display-backlink-preview-on-hover" >}} is all about.
