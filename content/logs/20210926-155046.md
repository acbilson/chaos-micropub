Today the city of Evanston blocks off much of Ridge Ave (a busy thoroughfare) for bikers to ride along. There are charities along the sidewalk and a live band in Ridgeville Park.
 Graham's a little on edge and sensitive to all the people, but he's enjoying the novelty of all the roads blocked off and police cars everywhere. Royal squeals with delight every time he sees a baloon.
