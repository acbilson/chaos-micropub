That was the worst four-day weekend I've survived in ages.

I was stuck with my second COVID vaccine shot on Thursday and within hours was feeling all the worst symptoms of a fever: body aches, chills, sinus pressure. I went to bed early, hoping to jump-start the recovery, and took a Friday sick-day.

Friday was worse. All the pain, all day. The kids were miraculously good for Amie, so I was able to get hours of extra sleep, but there was no change.

Saturday the aches and chills lessened, but a new problem cropped up. Allergies. My nose ran and my eyes watered from the moment I awoke until late into the night. If I leaned over, the sinus pressure was so great I felt my head would pop like a balloon. This is with daily Claritin and two sets of Benadryl.

Sunday was not a whit better. Same symptoms, no relief.

By Monday, resentment was added to the mix. A long weekend wasted by allergies and sickness (huff).

The suffering wasn't isolated to myself. Amie was only just beginning to recover from her own COVID vaccine on Thursday and was exhausted from Royal's night-time wakes. Both Graham and Royal were sick all weekend; Graham with a hacking cough and both with runny noses. The icing on the cake? Royal drank some stagnant water on Sunday and spent all of Monday in wriggling stomach pain and a mild fever as his body fought all the bacteria he'd ingested.
