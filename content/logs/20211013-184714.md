Today I upgraded my Raspberry Pi to Bullseye!

The latest Debian main distribution, {{< outref name=Bullseye src="https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/" >}}, was released on August 14th. I've been nervous about making the upgrade lest it take down the services I use on a daily basis, but it was surprisingly simple. Thanks to all those who contribute to Debian releases!

The best part is that Podman is now officially supported. Commands like `podman stats` now work as expected, and I can reliably pull new updates when they're released. Having used Podman for a few months now, I've grown to prefer it to Docker. I'm stoked that Podman desktop version will be available for my machine... someday.

It's often on my mind to migrate my setup to the cloud, perhaps {{< outref src="https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/" name=Vultr >}}, but it's opportunities to fully operate my server that make me stay loyally attached to my Pi. It's also the most cost effective.
