Matt Webb's {{< outref name="muse" src="http://interconnected.org/home/2020/05/06/lockdown" >}} about "the After" - the fictitious time expanse beyond quarantine - is both thought-provoking and inspiring. He wrote the article in May, when the pandemic had only just begun to settle in, but his words are yet more relevant now that lockdown has truly become "normal."

I'm inspired to make our family's adjustment intentional. We're always fighting the urge to "just survive," but I don't want to get stuck in that useless mindset. It's time for action and change, not waiting for a future that'll never arrive! What changes are you embracing this holiday?
