It's been so great to have Val in town for a few days! She stopped by on Monday to hang out with Amie while I worked, then we visited Dick Ryan's place for a party in her honor. The boys happily played chase all over the living room, filling his house with laughter.

Amie connected with Christine and we're both ecstatic to discover that she's hooked on DBS! It seems like trips to Mafraq, Jordan and Dorren's influence has borne unsuspected fruit across the Evanston Vineyard. May it continue to bear fruit according to its kind for an expansive harvest!
