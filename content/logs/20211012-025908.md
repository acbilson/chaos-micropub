Since Friday I've been too overwhelmed with disappointment and anxiety to do more than the bare minimum; clean, eat, watch. A three-day weekend spent in a daze, the anxiety only worsening as the hours slip away. The worst of it may finally be passing but to be this derailed doesn't speak well of my emotional reserves.

Let's practice a little gratitude. I'm thankful for:

- About fifteen years of life with Jesus. He's restored me out of crippling seasons so many times that my hope goes deep and the discouragement doesn't last as long. 
- Amie's perspective. When I can manage to put words to my feelings, she's generously reflective. All the criticisms that attend my words are lost in her reframing.
- Our two remarkable boys. I was nearly ready to commit Royal to involuntary fasting for the day after he threw yogurt across the floor, but both of them do such surprising and funny antics that it's exceedingly difficult to remain frustrated long. Graham said to Amie, "I wanna show you something, Mamacita." ðŸ˜†
