Yesterday I was the most desperate I've been in months. Our cantankerous children pushed every boundary until I was shaking with pent up frustration. The broken system to get our bathroom leak fixed put me in a continual state of anger. And the powerlessness of both left me lonely and in despair. The day might have ended in darkness had it not been for the gentle whisper of the Holy Spirit as I carried dinner home. I wept to hear that I was not alone. **Not Alone.** So we get up, dust off our scarred hearts, and limp forwards again. Together.
