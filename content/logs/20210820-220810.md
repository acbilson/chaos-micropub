Another week past. Work took half the week to calm down from last week's fiasco, but all has finally normalized.

I'm grateful for the time spent with others this week. We've had numerous conversations about seeing a movement in Chicago and several chances to encourage and exhort others. It's likely that we'll host a DBS group this Fall with some we've met, which is an exciting prospect.

The question, "how can I help?" has been so useful to learn how I might get involved in other's needs. It's a keeper.
