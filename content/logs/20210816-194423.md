Sometimes there's just so much going on it's hard to keep up. I end up with 50+ tabs on my phone's browser from all the articles I hope to read in greater depth. Only that never happens. Here's a few thoughts I wanted to get down so I can close some tabs!

{{< outref name="Half of American's Can't Afford a One-Room Rental" src="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/12/housing-renter-affordable-data-map?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" >}}

My eyes perk up whenever I see articles like this because I keep trying to make sense of my own experience. Amie and I have no debt, I make a high salary, and we have an affordable 15-year mortgage, yet it seems to be _just_ enough for us to live the dream of a single-income household. Our friends and neighbors lack many or all of these benefits and often have additional obstacles. If we're exceedingly privileged and well-positioned and it's just enough for our little family, how is the rest of America faring?

When I pulled the Guardian's data apart it was too general to make any concrete statement, but it does reflect a trend.

{{< outref name="The History of the Web" src="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/timeline/?date_from=all" >}}

A resource that's fun to page through. It's amazing that the Internet has managed to stay organized enough to remain generally interoperable across the world.

{{< outref name="Apple Privacy Update for Child Safety" src="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/" >}}

There's some controversy in tech privacy/freedom circles about Apple's decision to scan photos on our iPhones. That sounds bad, and it would be, but they're doing a few more things to minimize the invasive nature of their scanning and the data that might be gathered from a scan. My personal opinion is that Apple has done all I could imagine possible to solve a horrifying problem without creating worse privacy concerns and, in this specific case, I'd rather they take action than remain passively involved.

{{< outref name="Comparison of Vaccine Effectiveness With SARS-CoV-2 Variants" src="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452771v1.full" >}} && {{< outref name="SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Cases" src="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109072?query=featured_home" >}}

I'm still learning the underlying material to understand this research paper, but it's my aim to learn enough about genetics, vaccines, and the human immune system to make sense of this research and others like it. Stay tuned for a full-size article!

{{< outref name="60 Years of Woodland Regeneration" src="https://theconversation.com/monks-wood-wilderness-60-years-ago-scientists-let-a-farm-field-rewild-heres-what-happened-163406" >}}

This was an encouraging story about the regeneration of farmland back to a woodland habitat. We don't know enough about how the Earth will heal from our involvement, but it's wonderful to read about the astounding resilience and self-repairing nature of creation. Most repair will require more human involvement to set right where we've made mistakes, but it's encouraging nonetheless.

{{< outref name="The State of US Open Banking" src="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/open-banking-treasury-prime" >}}

I've been complaining about bank systems for a long time. I'd have jumped ship to another bank if I really thought there was a better option. I'm surprised, and yet not so surprised, that other parts of the world aren't locked up with crappy standards. Might be time to move to a Swiss bank ðŸ˜Ž.
