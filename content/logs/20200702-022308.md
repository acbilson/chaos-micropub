Six years and four cars later, Pilo’s remains the best auto service I’ve ever used. His prices are reasonable, his work is thorough, and his integrity is matchless. Today he fixed our transmission, not by replacing the whole (which would have been thousands of dollars) but only the part that would get us through the next 50,000 miles.

If you need a mechanic, your search is over. {{< outref name="Go to Pilo" src="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bryn+Mawr+%26+Kedzie+Auto+Service,+Inc.,+5604+N+Jersey+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60659/@41.9812317,-87.7012483,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880fce0f0c2577bb:0x6b854ab509fa1d6" >}}! Tell Natalia that the Bilson’s sent you.
