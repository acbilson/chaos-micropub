I've revamped how I publish new comments. Not only is comment publishing now mobile-friendly, but I can allow other users to create them! For now, only Amie has the privilege.

> Note: "comments" here refer to published work, not comments at the bottom of a publication. Those kind of comments are still available for anyone willing to authenticate.
