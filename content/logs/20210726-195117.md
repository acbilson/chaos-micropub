It is remarkable that, despite driving half-way across the country, meeting all sorts of new people and putting so many new things in his mouth, Royal was never seriously sick on our vacation. A week back and he's got something that kept him coughing all night. He and I slept on the couch; a better option than rising to cuddle him every half-hour when a cough woke him. So I'm tired, sore, and ready for bed.
