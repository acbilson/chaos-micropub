Over the weekend the four of us traveled to Madison, WI, to see the grandparents. It was an impromptu affair, but fun to visit family and a good test-drive of our summer vacation drive. We joined them at the start of a week cleaning out the great-grandparent's hoard of wood, tires, lawn mowers, and more. My major contribution? Helping to pull an ancient appliance from the basement.

Tom paid for a hotel room so we could stay the weekend. Graham had a blast splashing in the pool, but Royal was undecided. He seemed uncomfortably cold.

Graham proudly carted wood to the garbage trailer and impressed everyone with his eagerness to help. In fact, both he and Royal brought joy to everyone. Especially when Graham's laughter filled the air, riding in a wheelbarrow while I ran him around the driveway.
