So many sparks today around obedience!

- the story of Saul. "To obey is better than sacrifice; to listen than the fat of rams."
- the development of consequences in David's life. He chose between three consequences in his later years. Also, consequences turned him towards, but away from, the Lord.
- the more God's covenant people fail, the more he presses into his covenant promises.
- disobedience doesn't equate to a total loss. God kept working with Abram to bring about blessing to the nations. God let Moses partially fill the role he'd at first denied.
- the simplicity of God's commands. He makes few demands and many promises. His commands aren't for laying out a perfect human life, but are a relational directive based in trust. To disobey says more about distrust than perfection. God is much less concerned about mistakes than about relational barriers.
