Matthew Kudija has written notes for a list of books, astonishing for both its prodigious length and breadth of subject matter. Here are a few book notes that revealed books I'd love to read.

- {{< outref name="The Bitcoin Standard" src="https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2021-03-14-The-Bitcoin-Standard.html" >}}

I know little about Bitcoin but am interested in economics and curious about this upstart monetary system.

The title drew me in. It reminds me of an invaluable book I'd read years ago (I don't remember the title) that gave me freedom to _not_ finish many books.

- {{< outref name="Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder" src="https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2020-12-21-Antifragile.html" >}}

Nassim Taleb's name keeps popping up. This looks like a great place to start with his work.

- {{< outref name="The 48 Laws of Power" src="https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2014-06-05-The-48-Laws-of-Power.html" >}}

Since Matthew has written the laws down, I probably don't need to read the book. But I would like to compare/contrast these with Jesus' style of power.

- {{< outref name="Finding Darwin's God" src="https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2014-08-07-Finding-Darwin%E2%80%99s-God.html" >}}

This would be a great way to continue my re-introduction with evolution after _Adam and the Genome_.
