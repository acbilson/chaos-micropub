Amie left to visit her parents in Madison yesterday afternoon. We ought to know by now that travel without prayer protection is a severe risk, but we're still learning this lesson. 

She drove off at the start of Royal's nap time. At Dempster and Crawford, about twenty minutes into the trip, a warning light flashed on. Low oil pressure. She called me.

We started to troubleshoot by checking the dipstick and discovered the oil reservoir was bone dry! Amie purchased a quarter at the nearby gas station, poured half in, and watched under the car for a leak. Nothing. She cranked the engine and, behold, the oil poured onto the asphalt!

I called the shop that we'd had our oil changed at to demand he send a mechanic, but it didn't take much - he handled it right away.

It had now been an hour into their trip. Graham was filthy from playing on the gas station ground and Royal was covered in chocolate snack and irritable from sleeplessness.

The mechanic discovered the problem - the oil filter was faulty! Whether because it was the wrong one or not, I do not know. But the mechanic hadn't brought the right replacement, sonhe drove back to the shop for another filter.

By the time he'd returned it was over two hours into the trip. Graham was doing okay, but Royal was melting down and refusing to get into his car seat. Amie was frazzled and almost ready to come home.

The trip still happened, but oh the drama. Moral of the story - ALWAYS ask for prayer when traveling!
