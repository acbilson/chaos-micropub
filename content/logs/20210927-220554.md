Last Thursday, I dropped Amie off at the Urgent Care with severe abdominal pain before picking up the boys from school. To our surprise, the doctor recommended Amie head to the ER so, instead of picking her up to take her home, we picked her up to drop her at the hospital.

Amie spent the whole night in the ER undergoing various tests to discover why her gallbladder was inflamed. By the morning she was expected to have it removed, but the day-shift contradicted the night crew and decided it wouldn't be necessary. In other words, try again later ðŸ˜•.

I took Friday off to care for the kiddos, reminded once again that caring for two young boys by myself is a herculean task; props to mama Hercules. We finally picked Amie up from the hospital in the afternoon.

The boys did well in her absence. Graham melted down when he realized mama wouldn't "sit a w'ittle" while he fell asleep.
