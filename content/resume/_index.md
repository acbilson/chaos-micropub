Hi there! &#128075;&#127995;

Hiring is an anxiety-producing process. You don't know me, I don't know you, a poor match costs us both. Ugh.

This page aims to ease your aprehensions by laying out, in plain terms, where my career journey has taken me and where I think it's heading next.

I have a fledgling tech company and hired Alex Bilson to be a project manager for our first app. We already had a prototype and wanted to add functionality to it before beta testing it. Alex was very thoughtful, detailed and thorough in evaluating my problem and presenting possible solutions. He gave me a comprehensive implementation plan with varying options with cost and time estimates. I have no tech background. Alex was able to convert highly technological ideas and processes into something I could understand and make decisions about what I wanted. The cost to implement the added functionality wouldâ€™ve been a few thousand dollars. Alex recommended that I already had enough to do beta testing and that it might be better to wait until I get feedback before making changes. I appreciated his honesty and integrity. Alex keeps deadlines, is punctual and has a calming presence. I decided to go forward with beta testing and I will hire him again when Iâ€™m ready to upgrade my app. I highly recommend him. - Andrea Bacon

<h1>Q & A </h1>

<ul>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: What libraries have you used for unit testing?</p>
<p>A: I write unit tests for all but the smallest projects. Libraries like NUnit and Moq are my go-to for C# development, Pester for PowerShell, and PyTest for Python.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: Have you written integration or end-to-end tests?</p>
<p>A: Yes! For value, a single end-to-end test is more useful than five integration tests, which are more useful than a hundred unit tests. The best coverage has appropriate coverage by all.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: What's your favorite IDE?</p>
<p>A: I began with Vim, and it's still my go-to for adhoc development work. I love how it's everywhere, and the commands are burned into my fingers. Visual Studio Code has become my workhorse for big projects... once I add the Vim plugin.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: What's your favorite OS?</p>
<p>A: I spend my days on the command line, so Linux has become my happiest home. I appreciate the simplicity of the folder structure and the many command line tools available. When I'm on Windows, I install Gow at the minimum, and <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> 2 with Debian if I can. The Mac terminal experience is decent, so I guess it's alright.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: How do you debug a 250-line SQL script?</p>
<p>A: Carefully! My first work on large SQL scripts was at Relativity, where I'd routinely need to fix a bug introduced in the latest release. I take a systematic approach, decomposing the script into readable output step-by-step until I've isolated the bug.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: What steps do you take to debug a Web API endpoint?</p>
<p>A: First I'll serve the endpoint locally so I can play with it without disruption. Unless this is adhoc, I'd build up a Postman library to simplify authentication and configuration. If it's adhoc, I might bust out curl instead. I'd confirm my setup by hitting an endpoint that has no bug first, then move to the one with a bug. If I can set a breakpoint and debug at the code level, great, otherwise I'd add logging to inspect how the endpoint is responding to my requests. When the bug was found, I'd write a failing unit test that describes the bug, then update the code to pass the test.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="question">Q: What technical certification would you pursue next?</p>
 <p>A: I'm about 80% through the Certified Ethical Hacker cert from EC-Counsel. Security is crucial in technology, and the hacker's approach fascinates me. Maybe someday I'll be a white hat...</p>
</li>

</ul>
