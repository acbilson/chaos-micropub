Since adding the capacity for users to enter comments, I must now elucidate my site policies.

# Privacy Policy

I require users to identify themselves before posting content. I hope this will cut down on spam and encourage dialogue. Rather than collect your information, I ask common websites like Facebook to confirm that they know you. I store their answer so you don't have to confirm every time you write.

# Data Policy

My site is like a brick-and-mortar library. As the curator, I decide what books are on my shelf whether I've written the content or not. I do offer the works of other authors and will not modify their content without permission. But I might take it off the shelf.

If you write a comment on my site, it's my prerogative to show or remove it. However, I won't misrepresent your writing by changing any of the text, images, emojis or punctuation you've written. If you do wish to amend a comment, contact me and, unless it breaches my content policy, I'll update your comment.

# Content Policy

This is my garden, and I won't have weeds and dirt overtake all my gardening effort. If I find anything you've written offensive or bland, I will remove it. I want neither pornography nor empty "likes".
