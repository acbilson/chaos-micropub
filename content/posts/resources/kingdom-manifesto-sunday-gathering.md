As a painter returns to his work to apply a fresh layer of dimension, so I hope to further define my original [Kingdom Manifesto](). I will dispense with the introductory work and apply new strokes to the largest of the Kingdom meetings, Sunday gatherings.

# Sunday Gatherings as a Service (SGAAS)

The centrality of the Sunday gathering is embedded in the United State's social fabric. It is the subject of countless books, podcasts and blogs, and has developed an entire vocabulary. Consider some Sunday-specific slang:

"Seeker" refers to a person who is not yet committed to ~Sunday gatherings~ Jesus but has courageously jumped the chasm between their environment and the Church enough to attend a Sunday gathering. It is a testament to the compelling power of Jesus' community that anyone makes it through the doors.

A church that's labeled "seeker-friendly" tries to reduce the seeker's chasm-jump distance by synthesizing more with the seeker's environment. Sometimes it can also mean that the church edits its messages to reduce friction, ranging from reducing slang terms to avoiding entire subjects. These ought to be separate terms, I think. Maybe "seeker-friendly" and "seeker-safe"?

"Member" refers to an individual who has promised to pay regular ~dues~ tithe, to attend more Sunday gatherings than they miss, and sometimes to volunteer.

A church with member registration is trying to weed out the "seekers" from the "finders" (made that last up). A member registry is useful for a number of reasons, such as to count the actual number of committed ~attendees~ Christians to gauge the relative growth of church commitment over time.

If you work in a technology marketing department, these definitions might be familiar with different terms. Swap "seeker" for "visitor," "member" for "customer", and the rate of church commitment as the "conversion rate." I don't know who stole which idea from whom, but there's comical overlap.

I want you to understand with this tongue-in-cheek slang comparison that the Sunday gathering is conceptualized and marketed exactly the same way that a company conceptualizes its core offering. As radical as an entrepreneur announcing that to his company that we've misidentified our company's fundamental service, I propose that we the Church have mistaken the Sunday gathering as our fundamental service. We the church need an innovative disruption to stay "relevant."

# Sunday Gatherings in a new Light

Ok, so I've just stated that Sunday gatherings are not a fundamental service. Does that mean we do away with them? By no means! Instead, let's place the Sunday gathering in a more modest position alongside the other three meetings/services. You may call them "the four fundamental services" if you'd prefer alliterative genius.

- discovery 1: a church without a sunday gathering is still a church
- discovery 2: an attendee that's not a member is still a committed Christian
- discovery 3: a startup church may require significantly fewer resources than expected

-----------------------

**Summary**

Kingdom communities benefit tremendously when the roles and gifts of all Christians are expressed and shared. Teachers with sound theological instruction protect the community from heresy and build up its faith, hope, and love; prophets encourage and guide the community through challenges and into opportunities, administrators organize large functions where mutual sharing and group service can be expressed. Without Sunday gatherings, Kingdom communities remain scattered collections of Christians with a loosely cohesive mission; with them, the community reminds itself of its shared and unified purpose and labor in the world.

**Synonyms:** &bull; celebration &bull; huddle &bull; conference &bull; church service

**Biblical examples:**

- Jewish synagogue
- Paul’s lectures in Ephesus
- Jesus’ sermon on the mount

**Effect over regularity**

Sunday gatherings have been regulated more than any other meeting. Regulations include: weekly meetings that are seeker-friendly, feature a single speaker, and offer community announcements. These regulations, and others like them, are less important than the effect Sunday gatherings have to unify the disparate parts of the Kingdom community towards a common vision. Sunday gatherings may become more relevant if less frequent.

**Celebration over discovery**

Sunday gatherings remind participants of their shared purpose: to love God and their neighbors. The opportunity to celebrate with one another is valuable because it is so rarely done.

# Confession

This manifesto is incomplete, for who can escape the gravity of one's circumstances to envision a community different from one's own? It is bound by my humanity, by time and space, by errors, foibles, and misunderstandings. Nonetheless, it is uniquely my own, and I believe that I also have a measure of God's Spirit.

Thank you for listening.
