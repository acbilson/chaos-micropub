Many have undertaken to compile a list of baby resources, and it seemed fitting that we too should offer the list of online baby resources as we are analysts and take a unique approach.

Analysts don't want to be told which baby item is the "best" - we want to gauge what's best for our situation on a list of criteria. For the analyst's baby item research, nothing beats [Baby Gear Lab](https://www.babygearlab.com/).

Analysts thrive in structured environments and, it turns out, so do newborns. Endless advice is given, much of it contradictory, but the [Little One's Baby Sleep Program](https://www.littleones.co/collections/frontpage/products/baby) gives you a scheduling framework from which you may build your ultimate baby schedule. We suffered for months on our own to teach Graham to nap, but two days on this program and he was snoring away!

Analysts search for patterns and root causes. When an analyst encounters a being that follows no pattern, it can "perturb" the analyst, and the feelings and thoughts the analyst may feel towards their bundle of joy might alarm. If your baby stirs helplessness and rage, you'll be blessed to learn about [The Period of Purple Crying](http://purplecrying.info/).

Analysts prepare with detailed planning. The best resource to assist the analyst's journey towards birth, the [Birth Plan Creator](http://pregnancyandbaby.com/calendars/articles/937331/birth-plan-creator) offers a comprehensive template for questions and decisions.

Analysts are skeptical about pat answers and want to know the facts upon which decisions form. The variety of ailments and symptoms a tiny human may display is vast, but a prepared analyst can handle almost every issue that arises with the [Pediatric Telephone Protocols](https://www.amazon.com/Pediatric-Telephone-Protocols-Office-Version/dp/1610021967/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pediatric+telephone+triage&qid=1582229300&s=books&sr=1-1). This is the exact reference used by pediatric clinics to assess children, and it doesn't take a nursing degree to utilize. There are frequent editions so, to cut costs, you might purchase an earlier edition. A two-year-old book's content will be almost identical to this year's edition.
