The most common reaction to the word "evangelism" is discomfort. This can range from the mild discomfort of shame that you're not doing enough of it to an allergic reaction that anyone would foist their views on another. Generally, it's not a word that elicits excitement, wonder, or joy. Come with me through a few paradigm shifts and see if, perhaps, we can reduce your discomfort and grow your joy.

# Evangelism isn't delivering a packaged product called "the gospel"; it's an introduction to Jesus, your closest friend and Ruler of the Universe

American's love to reduce complex concepts into byte-sized marketing messages. Many Christians think of a verse or two written by Paul when they hear the word "gospel." A few hear gospel hallelujahs, or a message printed on the back of a gospel tract. Even fewer think of the first four books in the New Testament.

The word "gospel" translates the Greek word εὐαγγελίου. Transliterate the Greek and you get the English word "evangel"; the root of "evangelist" and "evangelism". Literally the word translates "good news."

When Mark wants to tell you "the gospel," he begins and ends with a story that lasts more than sixteen pages. The opening words confirm he believes the story he's sharing is the good news:

> The beginning of the good news [εὐαγγελίου] of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. (_ESV_, Mark 1:1)

He doesn't limit the scope of his story to his writing; however, but expands his gospel definition to the writings of those who've gone before him:

> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet (_ESV_, Mark 1:2)

When you share a story about Jesus, you are sharing "the good news". This story can be one from the Gospels, or it can be from your own encounters with our Treasure. It doesn't matter.

## Practices To Try

- Share a story about Jesus. Memorize it so it becomes part of you, not to deliver it verbatim. In fact, feel free to put the story in your own words. Then share the story in casual conversation with someone and see what happens. You might say something like, "That reminds me about this one time..." If you're nervous, you can ask first, "May I share a story about Jesus with you? I think you'd enjoy it."

- Share a story about encountering Jesus.

# Evangelism's goal is not a conversion moment; it's making disciple-making disciples.

Certain theological systems define conversion at a single point in an individual's life when they were {{< acronym saved "a Christian term loaded with many meanings depending upon context. Essentially, a transition from being an outsider to an insider." >}}. Identifying this moment is a crucial piece of a person's {{< acronym testimony "a Christian term which means a personal story of an encounter with God" >}}. The moment is marked by inward experience in some traditions, or an outward ritual in others. Depending on the system, the authenticity of this moment can be brought into question if the converted's life exhibits little or temporary change. In these cases, the conversion moment is nullified and must _actually_ happen in order to truly be saved.

Contrary to this system, Jesus had only one request of those he encountered, "follow me." All a person had to do to be in the "in" crowd was be near him. No miraculous event, no faith confession, no ritual, only to walk around Galilee with him, or eat dinner at one of his friend's parties, or even sneak into his home late at night.

After he taught a rag-tag bunch of men and women about his kingdom, he left the keys in their hands. Some of them didn't believe him even then, but that didn't stop him. "I am all-powerful. As you go, make disciples of all the peoples... teach them how to do all I've told you. And I will be there with you the whole time."

## Practices To Try

- Ask a person you've mentored in some capacity about their experience. Were they able to go and do likewise? What parts of your life with Jesus did they take on, and which did they not?

# Evangelism isn't persistent persuasion, it's discovering open ears.

There's a subtle mantra that underlies sharing Jesus. It goes something like, "If you love someone, you won't stop trying until they trust in Jesus."

Joy in Jesus is a gift worth sharing, and you're love for others will produce sadness when they disregard the chance to share your joy. But more often this mantra bears guilt that you haven't done enough.

- Enough sharing the gospel; "Do they understand my message?"
- Enough kindness and example; "Is my life attractive?"
- Enough prayer, fasting, etc. "Have I invested in intercession?"

However important communication, example and intercession, these are not your primary measure. These are all focused on your condition, but actually you're looking for response from _them_.

Jesus regularly ended parables with the line, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." He anticipated that some would hear his parables and respond. Others would hear and respond for a moment, but later give up. And others would hear his words and not understand.

It's okay to move on when there's no response after you share a gospel story with a person. This doesn't mean that their ears will be shut for all time, but it does mean that you're not responsible to batter down the gates.

## Practices To Try

- Write down a list of the people you see on a semi-regular basis. Your network. From that list, mark those with whom you've had some spiritual conversation. How did they respond? Select one person with whom you have not had a spiritual conversation and make a plan to share something about Jesus with them.
