Powerful innovation happens when an innovator takes a concept developed from one discipline and transfers its principles to another domain. Elon Musk is reported to do this himself. By studying a broad range of subjects he utilizes the greatest innovations in one discipline to solve challenges in another. The biochemist may not realize how her chemical innovation might revolutionize space travel because she doesn't know the challenges of that domain. An astronaut might.

DBS is an innovation from the missionary discipline, which means the average church leader is unfamiliar with it. Because it's been relegated to the evangelist or missionary silo, the church leader is unlikely to consider how the principles might solve the challenges in the traditional church. I believe the principles of DBS address many of the obstacles that plague traditional churches, but it may take a paradigm shift to apply them.

Jesus used stories to challenge people's conceptions of reality and plant seeds that would later transform their worldview. Here are a few true stories from our own experience that I pray will expand your paradigm.

- In 2014, we co-led the first Neighborhood group as a trimmed-down DBS. At thirteen attendees, it's the largest group we've led. The format allowed full participation from a diverse community of people. The system was so effective that the group often self-corrected when the conversation was straying from the structured questions, which left the facilitators plenty of room to participate. Facilitators require minimal training and preparation.

- In 2015, we led another DBS group. After only four weeks, we invited an unlikely leader to facilitate the night's study. She accepted, and her first words to the group were, "there are two things I've hoped never to do, speak or pray in front of others. Tonight I will do both." She facilitated the entire group splendidly and stated after the meeting was over that it was easier than she'd expected. The discovery questions were so helpful to her that she took them home to study the bible in private. Any layperson can facilitate a DBS group.

- In 2017, we led a DBS group advertised as the layman's approach to evangelism. One of those who attended openly admitted that he came because the subject of evangelism was so difficult for him that he needed a place to explore the subject. We committed on the first day to share the stories we read with fifteen people. I drew fifteen circles that we'd fill in with facial expressions to represent how people responded. The group shared sixteen stories over eight weeks with mostly smiles. Among the fruit of those conversations was a coworker who asked the sharer to study the bible with her and an aunt with whom the sharer was later able to have multiple spiritual conversations before she passed away. All of this from one of the questions, "With whom might you share this story?" The study's impact is felt beyond the group.

- In 2018, we led a DBS group through Jesus' I AM statements. Many of our discoveries made foundational shifts in the way we understand God and humans which permeate our lives today. For example, the passage where Jesus describes himself as the gate has influenced how I've interacted with coworkers for years now. I cannot remember most of the sermons I've heard in the past year, but I'll never forget the discoveries made in those short weeks. That's spiritual formation.

- In 2018, we led a DBS group with another couple through the entire book of Acts. Although I had no relationship with this couple before the group met, they were willing to drive through the city every week to our apartment for the next story. In that year they've become closer friends than those I've known for many years, and this occurred, not through a specialized relational group, but simply by interacting with the Bible together. This fosters committed community and relationships.

- Lately (2020), we co-led a basic DBS group through Mark's gospel with an even split between long-time Christians and family members with little-to-no experience of the Bible. There was full participation from everyone, both in shared insights and in action. We made such discoveries as 1. that Jesus was a real, historical person, 2. that one response is to emulate him, and 3. that those who discount his message have a closed mind, while those who consider his words are open-minded. We are excited to finish the story of Jesus in Mark's gospel with them over the next few weeks. The unchurched are welcome and comfortable participating in the discovery.

Church planters needed the means to establish Jesus communities that conformed to the host culture, had all the DNA of a church gathering, and could multiply beyond the strength of the church planter's arm. And so DBS was born. Could it be that the Church abroad has discovered principles that might revitalize the Church at home in these challenging times?

> The picture is not, in fact, a DBS group. It's my birthday party. But DBS looks just like this (though often on typical furniture).
