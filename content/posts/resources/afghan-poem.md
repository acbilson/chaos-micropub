After my deployment to Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy, I had a lot to process. Poetry was the result.

> My interpretation of what happened in Afghanistan has deepened since I wrote this poetry. Don't assume you understand my current theology because you've found misunderstanding in a poem I penned in 2011.

###Beginning

{{< poetry >}}
Swift sailing through the sea of life
Weather diverse but He is near
Spirit close calms every fear
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Waves crash vain upon my bow
Shall circumstances rock my hold
Upon the Lord of grace foretold?
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Nay, victory is mine through Christ
Almighty conqueror of death
The world’s released its bated breath
{{< /poetry >}}

###Trickery

{{< poetry >}}
The worse is past now no more work
I think I’ll take some time to rest
Comfort seems to me the best
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Lay my head on Ease’s lap
Complacency bids me to sleep
“Hush now, there’s no watch to keep”
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Cool breeze lulls my eyes to droop
Dreams of glory, honor, power
Only I, man of the hour
{{< /poetry >}}

###Withdrawal

{{< poetry >}}
Self-exalted, basement fails
Structure crumbles with a crash
Wood and stubble turn to ash
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
(Respite reveals the heart of man
When labor turns to selfish ease
Corrupt affections to appease)
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Wake in dread, the sails have stilled
Windless, caught without a breeze
Trapped within the glassy seas
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Face of God has turned away,
Temptation raises banner high
Without help I’ll surely die
{{< /poetry >}}

###Lament

{{< poetry >}}
Empty thoughts devoid of light
Stretch the hold to nearly burst
Abundant water, always thirst
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Now my daily sustenance
Leaves me empty, incomplete
Tasteless is the Godly meat
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
What my soul had once refused
Worldly bread I once had known
In my stomach turns to stone
{{< /poetry >}}

###Questions

{{< poetry >}}
Accusations fill my lips
Questions swirl within my head
Am I counted as the dead?
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Is my strength akin to stones?
Does my flesh consist of brass?
Are not all my days as grass?
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Do I have an arm like God?
Present at the start of time?
Creator each after their kind?
{{< /poetry >}}

###Help?

{{< poetry >}}
I’ve no strength cannot progress
Fate hinges on holy wind
Word speaks, “He must condescend”
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Spirit of the Living God
I have no handle on Thee
Hope only on Your mercy
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
I can’t draw the love of God
No bucket, and the well is deep
Within Joseph’s well to sleep
{{< /poetry >}}

###Repentance

{{< poetry >}}
Who am I to complain thus?
My iniquity ascends
Far above lofty heavens
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
I was raised in countless sins
Every day I add the cost
To Jesus’ flesh upon the cross
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
My just lot is death in hell
If were not for His mercy
As He hung upon the tree
{{< /poetry >}}

###Resolved

{{< poetry >}}
If I know not Christ in God
There is nowhere else to turn
I shall seek Jesus - or burn
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Am I not Thy purchased prize?
Make me so despite my life
Thou art greater than all strife
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
You deserve my every breath
Poured out for Your endless praise
Even if my soul won’t raise
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
To life endless in Your love
Under Thy judgment I must
Say, “Lord all you speak is just”
{{< /poetry >}}

###Return

{{< poetry >}}
Humility floods through my soul
Limbs splayed out upon the deck
Nothing left now to protect
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Honesty pours grimly forth
From a heart without a pulse
The hull begins to convulse
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
What is this! slips from my mouth
Sails snap to my great surprise
I can feel the breeze arise!
{{< /poetry >}}

###Exultation

{{< poetry >}}
God has heard my desperate prayer
Healing on His outspread wings
Mercy great my heart now sings!
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Restored at the foot of Christ
Heart leaps in renewed delight
Jesus, Jesus fills my sight!
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Knowing what it means to feel
Separated from the Lord
Leaving twice I can’t afford
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Strive to walk in holy fear
Truly this is the start of
Wisdom, knowledge from above
{{< /poetry >}}

###Advance

{{< poetry >}}
In your Spirit daily march
Mortifying flesh by grace
Gazing always on Your face
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Jesus take the conning wheel
Steer the ship as you see fit
Riding into bright sunset
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Where lie the celestial shores
Promised to fathers of old
To their sons continually told
{{< /poetry >}}

###Longing

{{< poetry >}}
When I reach the crystal shore
Leaping from the soggy planks
I’ll join Your people on the banks
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Of Jordan where the faithful cross
To meet our Husband in the air
The virgin bride, His love all fair
{{< /poetry >}}

{{< poetry >}}
Sing grateful hallelujahs
To the Lamb upon the throne
Oh, I can’t wait to be home!
{{< /poetry >}}
