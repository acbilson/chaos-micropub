How does Jesus' Kingdom community organize? Is the Sunday gathering primary? What are 'micro' groups? These are the sort of questions that keep me up into the wee hours of the morning. Will you join me in an exercise to loosely structure a Kingdom community?

# Definitions

First, what the heck is 'Kingdom community'? Don't you just mean church?

Certain words have baggage from long practice. Most church attendees agree that the church building != the Church (ἐκκλησία, the 'called out ones'), yet our practices reflect another conviction. I aim to shake our categories a little by ditching well-used words in favor of new, less baggage-ridden (I hope) words that I can be invested with new concepts. I'll let someone else try to redeem 'church' and 'Christian'.

# Why Care?

Second, why care how a Kingdom community organizes?

Let me list a few axioms.

1. We humans flourish by loving God and neighbor with our whole being.

2. To love God and neighbor isn't an ephemeral command about our intentions or feelings, but about the actions, we take in everyday life.

3. The vast majority of our actions are subconscious, i.e. we react more than reason.

4. Subconscious actions originate from our hearts; the core of who we are.

5. Our hearts are transformed foremost by habitual practice.

Now let me add to this one more:

6. Habitual practice of loving acts is best fostered in a community.

So, following my dense logic,

> **humans flourish in communities who habitually practice loving acts towards God and neighbor.**

Thus, one ought to care about the way Kingdom communities are formed because their organization directly affects human flourishing.

# Kingdom Meetings

Let's turn to the subject. When you consider how a Kingdom community might orient on a given week, at least four meetings exist:

- friendship groups
- special interest groups
- discipleship groups
- Sunday gatherings

These four exist in tension, like rubber bands holding an object in suspension. A community that entirely lacks one of these bands may still suspend in the air, but it means the other bands must exert greater tension to maintain the center. Remove two and the community may suspend off-center; three and it dangles helplessly in space. The four meetings ought to stretch and contract to fit the cultural and circumstantial needs of the geographical location in which the Kingdom community resides. While communities that lack one or more of these meetings exist as true Kingdom communities, the over-stretched nature of their existing communities puts them at greater risk of malformation.

## Friendship

**Summary**

Hindrances abound for the individual who seeks to grow in the fundamental qualities of a Christian; qualities such as obedience, humility, and compassion. Trauma, loneliness, spiritual attack, and a lack of self-awareness are a few reasons we don't develop deeper humility, comprehensive obedience, or genuine compassion. Close friendships, where individuals are welcome to encourage and confront one another from an intimate, confidential relationship, are a powerful means of character growth. Friendship groups, whether formally named or not, are about two to four people who move towards a total commitment to one another, complete transparency, and a unified mission.

**Synonyms:** &bull; micro groups &bull; accountability partners &bull; teams

**Biblical examples:**

- Jesus, Peter, James, and John
- Paul, Silas, Timothy
- David and Jonathan

**Intimacy over comfort**

Friendship meetings exist to foster intimacy, which is a fundamental ingredient of personal transformation. Few moments are more powerful than when one shares one’s darkest secrets with another human being and receives compassion. Conversely, small talk is comfortable but devoid of intimacy. Seek intimacy.

**Comraderie over diversity**

Friendship meetings exist to bundle people together in resilient, transformative relationships. It's less relevant for a friendship meeting to have diverse viewpoints than to have a common purpose.

## Special Interest

**Summary**

Transformation into the image of Jesus is an essential task of the Kingdom community, yet leaders recognize many adjacent needs that require attention to specific community segments. For example, financial wisdom deserves periodic attention, or the training of a weakly-represented spiritual gift, or healing for members with unresolved trauma.

**Synonyms:** &bull; skill training &bull; topical teaching

**Biblical examples:**

- Paul, Pricilla, and Aquilla at work making tents

**Instruction over friendship**

Special interest meetings target a segment of the Kingdom community to bolster its health and wellbeing. Any friendship built as the result of shared experience is welcome but tangential to the meeting's purpose.

**Practice over knowledge**

Special interest meetings are tethered to the core purpose of the Kingdom community, to love God and neighbor, and must not devolve into knowledge transfer alone. This is especially relevant in American communities, where knowledge is prized above practice.

## Discipleship

**Summary**

Discipleship meetings are the vehicle for Kingdom building and expansion. Diverse groups who engage God's words to discover his commands and character, to confront human nature, and to apply these discoveries to their lives are moved to make disciples of all nations. Highly reproducible, discipleship meetings can be constituted of Christians only, of Christians and not-yet-Christians, or entirely of non-Christians. These are inherently Bible-oriented, but not topical. This is because the Bible, the gifts of Christian participants, and the Holy Spirit's leading are the most powerful means of discipleship available.

**Synonyms:** &bull; discovery bible studies (DBS) &bull; small groups

**Biblical examples:**

- The twelve apostles
- House churches in Paul’s letters
- David’s mighty men

**Obedience over knowledge**

Discipleship meetings put the Bible's claims, instructions, and demands before participants and inspire them to wrestle out their responses together. They enable participants to interact with other's perspectives, ideas, and backgrounds through a shared encounter with the Bible. Participants should never stop at knowledge but take what's been discovered and apply it to their lives.

**Contribution over consensus**

Discipleship meetings are centers of diversity. It's less important that everyone agree than that all participate.

**Discovery over instruction**

Discipleship meetings facilitate the discovery of the Bible's claims whatever prior experience an individual may possess. All participants grant space for others to learn at their own pace, and actively avoid building knowledge hierarchies.

**Innovation over conformity**

Discipleship meetings package core principles in new models to better engage with their participants and neighbors. Principled exploration and risk-taking are encouraged over conformity to other discipleship groups.

**Multiplication over addition**

Discipleship meetings replicate by inviting seekers to launch new groups with people in their networks over invitations to add new members to existing meetings.

**Coaching over centralization**

Discipleship meeting facilitators are coached by facilitators from another group. Loose central control is encouraged to foster expansion and innovation.

## Sunday gathering

**Summary**

Kingdom communities benefit tremendously when the roles and gifts of all Christians are expressed and shared. Teachers with sound theological instruction protect the community from heresy and build up its faith, hope, and love; prophets encourage and guide the community through challenges and into opportunities, administrators organize large functions where mutual sharing and group service can be expressed. Without Sunday gatherings, Kingdom communities remain scattered collections of Christians with a loosely cohesive mission; with them, the community reminds itself of its shared and unified purpose and labor in the world.

**Synonyms:** &bull; celebration &bull; huddle &bull; conference &bull; church service

**Biblical examples:**

- Jewish synagogue
- Paul’s lectures in Ephesus
- Jesus’ sermon on the mount

**Effect over regularity**

Sunday gatherings have been regulated more than any other meeting. Regulations include: weekly meetings that are seeker-friendly, feature a single speaker, and offer community announcements. These regulations, and others like them, are less important than the effect Sunday gatherings have to unify the disparate parts of the Kingdom community towards a common vision. Sunday gatherings may become more relevant if less frequent.

**Celebration over discovery**

Sunday gatherings remind participants of their shared purpose: to love God and their neighbors. The opportunity to celebrate with one another is valuable because it is so rarely done.

# Confession

This manifesto is incomplete, for who can escape the gravity of one's circumstances to envision a community different from one's own? It is bound by my humanity, by time and space, by errors, foibles, and misunderstandings. Nonetheless, it is uniquely my own, and I believe that I also have a measure of God's Spirit.

Thank you for listening.
