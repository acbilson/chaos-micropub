After nearly three years of writing business insights for my MBA program, I've developed the writing habit. I've also passed from my twenties to my thirties and feel, perhaps for the first time, that I may have something to contribute to "the world". Writing to a global audience would paralyze me, so I've narrowed my purpose. If you find my posts helpful but aren't my target audience, what an encouraging side benefit.

### To Whom I Write

1. I write to myself. Writing helps me process, remember, and communicate what I've learned. Ideas don't become communicable until I've argued them out on paper. My best thoughts are full of holes, and I welcome constructive feedback. I refuse trolls, but I pledge to welcome and publish all criticism which helps me to grow as a thinker, a writer, and a doer of deeds.

2. I write to my children. They are too young to understand what I learn today, but one day they shall. By then I'll have forgotten what to say or from hindsight bias be incapable of sharing the learning journey. So I write today what they may need tomorrow.
