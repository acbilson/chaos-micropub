I received this thoughtful question in response to a log about [obedience and independence](https://alexbilson.dev/logs/20210611-160129/).

{{< notice type=quote name="Anonymous" long=true >}}
Since God places such a high value on children learning to be obedient to their parents, why would parents, especially Christian parents, want to deprive their kids of this in their upbringing?  The idea that this will somehow stunt a child's development into adulthood would mean that God doesn't know what's best for kids.
{{< /notice >}}

In addition, here's a link to a Tim Challies article titled {{< outref src="https://www.challies.com/articles/3-reasons-children-need-to-obey-their-parents/" name="3 Reasons Children Need to Obey Their Parents" >}}.

For me there are two burning questions: how do we teach children to be obedient, and what kind of parent is Tim addressing?

# Teaching Obedience

First, let's review how Tim thinks parents teach children to obey. I think a quote from Bryan Chapell at the end of his article presents a summary, "If we love our children too much to require them to do what is right, then we have not really loved them enough." There's also an underlying thought here; that the LORD himself demonstrates his love through enforced obedience. I particularly want to challenge the latter conclusion by asking, "How does God require obedience?," but let's keep looking at Tim's writing.

I dug through Tim's archives for a few minutes and unearthed two additional articles that I found helpful: {{< outref src="https://www.challies.com/articles/momentary-obedience-forever-honor/" name="Momentary Obedience, Forever Honor" >}} and {{< outref src="https://www.challies.com/articles/use-the-rod-lose-the-child/" name="Use the Rod, Lose the Child?" >}}

I found several synonyms to the word "require" in these articles, such as "enforce," "force," and "demand." Tim uses strong language, but that doesn't mean he advocates abusive forms of power. In fact, he believes his readers already know that he doesn't mean "anger-filled beatings but restrained, physical discipline that is done out of love and never tips into abuse" (Use the Rod, Lose the Child?). His use of provocative physical language seems to be focused on shaking parents out of a stupor, but he does draw a correlation between the use of physical discipline and a child learning how to obey. Which leads into the next question...

# Intended Audience

From what I can gather, Tim's intended audience are embattled American parents. Externally, their government and society frown upon the use of physical discipline, influencing them to ignore the long-standing practice; internally, their weak resolve prevents them from consistently enforcing their children's obedience by physical means. Tim desires to bolster parent's resolve to enforce discipline out of love for their children and to be bold in defense of their actions before the world.

# Shared Purpose

Tim and I share much in common. We both long for our children to reap the benefits of listening and obeying all that Jesus commands. We both fear that our society's influence on us and our children will do irreparable harm to everyone involved. At the road's end, we both want our children to grow into individuals who are eager to listen to God's voice, submissive to his commands, and resistant to contrary voices. So let's go back to the question, "How does God require obedience?"

# Does God Enforce Obedience?

The first opportunity to learn about God's approach to obedience is in Genesis 3, when {{< backref src="/bible/humanity-disregards-gods-wisdom-for-a-lie" >}}. The LORD has given humans a command, "don't eat fruit from this tree" and a consequence, "you will die." Then what happens?

If Tim and Bryan were retelling the story, God might demonstrate his love for humanity by stepping in to enforce their obedience. Maybe grab ahold of Eve's hand before she bites, or shout "STOP!". But He doesn't.

Instead, the LORD God calls to humans after they've disobeyed, engages them in conversation, questions their actions and elaborates on the subsequent consequences. He also supplies more than consequences; He gives them a promise that He will give humans victory over their deceiver.

# We're Saying the Same Thing

The rhetoric gets heated on this subject, probably from fear and discomfort. Parenting is a mighty task not lightly undertaken. At the root, I don't think Tim believes that physical discipline actually enforces obedience; I suspect he only wants parents to be consistent in making and executing consequences and not throw physical means out the window because the government says so. However, I'm not sure he's fully confronted how unforced the LORD's treatment of humanity is portrayed in the Bible or how little the Bible directly addresses our questions about parenting and discipline, physical and otherwise.

# My Perspective

It would not be fair to Tim if I questioned his perspective without offering more of my own to critique.

I agree that enforced consequences are crucial for the well-being of my children. When I have established both a command, "Graham pick up your toys," and a consequence, "or you will lose access to them until tomorrow," then it's in our mutual interest to remove Graham's toys when he does not obey. If I do not follow through, he infers that sometimes there are no consequences. This typically leads to more disobedience as he tests whether I'm setting a real boundary or only an idle threat. I wish to be as consistent as the LORD in supplying consequences and as merciful in being present with him as he bears the consequences with patient endurance.

I disagree that physical discipline is an approach worth fighting to uphold. On a personal level, while I can theorize that parents exist who always supply "restrained, physical discipline that is done out of love and never tips into abuse," I get too irate to promise myself I'll never tip over. I'm also playing the long game, and I don't see physical discipline as a viable option as my children become too big for me to wrangle or as an effective approach in the reformation of adults.

In summary, I do not believe that obedience can be enforced, only consequences. I don't fully understand why the LORD does not enforce His commands directly, but I trust His policy is good even as I groan under the combined weight of both centuries-old consequences and those solely brought upon by my own foolhardy decisions. I do not entertain physical discipline because I am restraining myself for my children's sake, and because it has an abysmal track record in the long-term.

# Final Comment

One last comment. There exist scenarios where the use of physical means does equate with love. When my son walks blindly into the street it is parental love to pluck him up and carry him out of harm's way (and give him a stern talk and establish a consequence afterward). Some consequences, like being hit by a car, are my loving responsibility to shield him from until his brain develops enough to make his own choices about safety.

I'm eager to learn how I can assist my children (and myself for that matter) to delight in obedience to Jesus. What have you found helpful?

Janet Lansbury’s approach to toddler discipline is the most Christ-like I’ve ever read. As a society we are painfully lacking in understanding child development. We have standards that are too high and we unintentionally shame children who are simply exploring in developmentally appropriate ways by enforcing “consequences” which are often just another word for punishment.

A relationship-based approach to parenting is how Jesus – IMO – relates to us. He does not relate to us through “do this or this happens”. I’m not saying life does not have consequences or that we leave our children alone without guidance. But how we do that in a way that is respectful and not abusing our power as parents and not enforcing disconnected consequences is a world all its own to discover.

Physical punishment of any kind IS abuse because it is an abuse of our parental power. Christians who give parenting advice with no regard for the 1000s of studies that prove the harm in spanking – even so called “restrained” spanking (even as little as once/week) – and are not educated in child development, should NOT be giving advice. I can barely pick up a Christian parenting resource without cringing. Even authors who explain their methods and then say it isn’t punishment are sadly deeply lost. Most advice I see from Christians is not loving – it is about controlling a child’s behavior. As you noted, that isn’t God’s approach with us at all. His approach is his relationship with us.

Children learn by modeling. Do we want our children to clean up? Then we clean up and they learn by watching us. If it is very important to you that your children pick up their toys or help, perhaps it becomes a game, maybe you clean up and he helps. Or doesn’t. This is another developmental question – is it appropriate to expect a toddler (0-5yrs) to clean up toys?

I could go on. I am very passionate about this topic. I am heartbroken by the way the church – generally speaking – talks about children and treats them. I believe it is a huge problem.

  Thanks Erin! We’ve regularly been helped by Janet Lansbury’s podcast. Your insight into tongue ties and sleep training (https://www.littleones.co/) have both been life-savers.

  The subject of expectations has also been on my mind. Every once in a while, when I’m exasperated by Graham’s actions or perceived unwillingness to listen, Amie reminds me that he’s only three years old. My standards have gotten even higher now that he has a younger brother. As you might imagine, their conflict resolution and style of relating are… less than ideal.

  However, I’ve also been stunned by the high expectations that the LORD exhibits towards humanity. For example, He fully expects all the Israelites to become a host of royal priests (Exodus 19:6), even though there’s little in their family track record to encourage such hope. I mean, hasn’t He read the Bible (lol)? There’s something honoring about genuinely high expectations, paired with mercy and presence, that I’d like to emulate.

  For example, I’m always playing catch-up with Graham’s skill level. A couple days ago I was sweeping up dinner crumbs and told Graham he could go play with trucks after he picked up his cup and plate. In a burst of inspiration, I asked if he’d like to help me sweep. He enthusiastically agreed and went on to sweep the entire dining room; even afterward picking up a few scattered pieces he’d missed. My expectations of what he could do were too low, and I noticed after I’d asked that he felt it was an honor to be invited to sweep; an honor I had denied him in part because I underestimated his ability and willingness.

    On the flip side; however, being a parent has given me first-hand experience of the fears, the stresses, and the chaos of parenting. Out of love for my children, a need for control, and sleep deprivation, I am very susceptible to whatever everyone else is doing; family and friends. After all, if it works for them, why not?

    My family’s decisions about physical discipline were made in a homogeneous culture, without the resources to take a break and reflect, and little validated exposure to competing ideas. I’m fairly certain that, were my place swapped with my mother’s, I could not have done better.

    It’s a sign of our new environment that most of the best parenting advice I’ve discovered has come from New Zealand. What?!

      I love hearing your insights and viewpoints, as usual. Thank you for sharing! I hope my comment about cleaning up didn’t come across too pointed – I was more piggy backing off your example to point out the idea of expectations and child development. Where do our expectations keep us from understanding and relating to our children in a way that respects where they are?
      This is a question I come back to often. Current example – Xander has become quite explosive at seemingly nothing toward guests when they first enter the house. I don’t want to shame or punish this behavior because I know that it is impulsive. He doesn’t know WHY he’s doing it and certainly can’t control it (to what degree, I’m not sure). He’s almost 3.5 so he’s entering into being able to problem solve with us and his empathy is now developing, but he’s still very much a baby and cannot control his actions. So how do I teach him societal rules without making it about him and his behavior? Today I simply stated the facts: “people don’t like being yelled at. If you want Aunt Kelly to let you sit in that chair, you could ask her.”
      A lot of it is in the delivery for me.

      Anyway, that’s my current and most constant question of “how do I do this?!” It’s very difficult!!!

## - - - - Erin Leck 8-2-2021 @ 8:47 PM

        Lastly, I have trouble with Christian circles making our relationship with our children somehow a parallel to that of ours with God. It simply cannot be the case because we are relating to God as adult children, not as actual children. So, much of what we see God doing in our lives just doesn’t make sense with kids. That seems obvious enough, but I think we stop short of thinking through it more. This is something I really want to talk to you guys about bc I’m been struggling to accept any Christian viewpoint when it comes to kids. The only thing I need is “children are first in God’s kingdom”. That alone is enough for me to throw out many of the Christian voices I hear and have experienced. At the risk of sounding intense, much of main stream parenting just feels like another system of oppression to me!

        Anyway, I’m 41 weeks pregnant so I’m not sure when we’ll be able to Zoom call – LOL. But I’ll email you guys. We miss you both so much! I love that we can still talk virtually. Hope to speak soon.

          No need to apologize. Numerous perspectives read my writing and I want to invite them into the conversation. Unlike Facebook, my aim is to have an open floor for dialog. More than a moderator, I’m hoping to be a facilitator.

          I’ve not read many parenting books, but I have felt nauseous paging through ‘Christian’ parenting books at Barnes & Noble. Amie and I have been listening to the Bible Project’s Family of God series, and that’s stirred conversation about parenting and sibling rivalry (something to look forward to 😃 ). First episode here.

## Erin Leck 7-29-2021 @ 11:57 PM

…I would love to discuss further if it interests you and Amie! I have so many thoughts, as well as my own experiences being brought up in a Christian home that used physical punishment as a way to “teach”. I’m so glad to see you thinking deeply about this stuff. Too many people do not dig deep enough…then cycles are repeated.

## - Alex Bilson 7-30-2021 @ 9:03 AM

  Amie and I would love that! Let’s find a time via email.
