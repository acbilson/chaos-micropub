Privilege is a common theme in the liberal-leaning city of Chicago, and exposure pressures me to consider my privilege and responsibility than if I lived elsewhere. I'm thankful for the pressure, though the subject is uncomfortable. Let's begin with a definition.

Privilege is a property of an individual that offers the person unearned benefits in society. It is often connected with other personal attributes, such as race, religion, and gender. The benefits conferred by privilege must be earned by those without its influence.

A common benefit bestowed by privilege is influence. A healthy, white man exerts less effort to gain and keep influence in an American technology workplace than a diabetic, Indian woman in the same role. The man, propelled by privilege benefits in education and comparative example{{< superset 1 >}}, must rarely prove himself and usually recovers from mistakes. The woman, whose journey to the same position was often hindered and always earned, labors to prove herself and is always at greater threat that the next mistake will permanently hinder her opportunities.

The privilege discussion in Chicago falters in action where it succeeds in definition. We have been enlightened by our privilege but not spurred to action. How could we, given that privilege is a static fact{{< superset 2 >}}?

{{< addendum >}}
By comparitive example, I mean the benefit gained from others like one's self publicly praised and promoted in society."
Privilege is most of the time static. An example of fluid privilege is education, which can be gained.
