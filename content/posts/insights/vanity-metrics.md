"Vanity metrics" are any statistic that makes a business sound successful without informing stakeholders about performance and growth areas {{< cite name=Ries loc="pg 143" >}}. Examples include:

- Sold 3,000 widgets last month alone! That’s a 112% increase over last month!

- Over 4 million users! Up 1 million since 2010!

- In six countries on two continents! Our global presence is expanding!

Excessive exclamation aside, these are examples of metrics that may be effective for the marketing team but give little insight into business operations. Entrepreneurs, whose obsession is to unlock growth for their venture, don't use this data to make business decisions. Sometimes, however, an entrepreneur can begin to rely on these metrics as business guides and forget to invest in the study of their customers and processes; the subjects their business is about.

The heroic stories of American startups may appear haphazard and encourage entrepreneurs to "just do it" (Nike). The reality of innovation; however, is that no one gets the idea right on the first go. When a business embeds valuable metrics into their processes from the start, they are equipped to make the inevitable pivots on the basis of sound data and customer interaction rather than gut instinct and fear. Ries outlines three essential characteristics of quality metrics. They are: actionable, accessible, and auditable {{< cite name=Ries loc="pg. 143-146" >}}.

**Actionable** means the data can be correlated with business actions. Like a valid scientific experiment, a good metric ought to control all variables except the independent. To put it another way, I ought to know whether it was my cold calls that increased the number of first-time customers last month and not the new packaging that the manufacturer put on the box. This is a goal to be aspired to rather than strictly maintained, however, since we never have strict control over the environment.

**Accessible** means the data is understood by all stakeholders. A metric that isn’t understood will be ignored or worse, may be used to validate behavior that has no correlation to business success. If the Sales department believes their success is tied to user count, and the numbers rise when their salespeople bully customers, then the metric might hide their abusive sales tactics for months, or even create a negative feedback loop where their performance is praised.

**Auditable** means the data must be reproducible. Any metric which cannot be verified with another test run is of little worth and may even erode stakeholder’s confidence. Not only does it need to be capable of a second execution, but it must also be capable of verification by the people whose actions it measures.

One business I know presents a series of business metrics at every All-Hands meeting. It may be one of the least helpful parts of the entire presentation for this reason: almost all the data qualifies as "vanity metrics." The data excels at market leadership promotion but tells me nothing about how the actions of the business over the past month have impacted the profit bottom line. The purpose of these meetings is to energize the company towards a single vision, and vanity metrics perform this function well, but they're like chocolate bites: a handful gives you a sugar high, but your body needs more to run at peak performance.
