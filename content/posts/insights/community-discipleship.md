This is the launch of a series of posts about my favorite way to facilitate community discipleship. I've been heavily influenced by the Discovery Bible Study (DBS) method but have refined the approach to meet the needs of city-based gatherings. If you're familiar with DBS, you'll recognize many of the questions and values.

Before we dig into specifics, let me share a vision for city transformation, what community discipleship means, and why it matters.

# A Vision for City Transformation

In 2014, Tempe, AZ, late at night, I went up a mountain to pray. There I received a vision from Jesus that's animated my passion for community discipleship.

After a period of silence to listen for Jesus' voice, the first verses of Jesus' mountain sermon came to mind. I began at the top, "blessed are the poor in spirit," and lifted my hands to pray over city that lay twinkling below me. About half-way through, a slideshow of relationships played in the theatre of my mind. I saw men threatening one another, a woman weeping alone in a bedroom, a family swindled by an unscrupulous salesperson. Each image vividly depicted broken relationships and their consequences. Then the reel shifted and I saw the same images transformed. I saw the angry man apologizing for his threats, I saw the woman forgive and re-enter community, I saw the salesperson acting justly. With passion fueled by these restored relationships, I prayed that the people of Phoenix would hear the words of Jesus and do what he said. I left the mountain with a conviction that cities are transformed when everyday people hear Jesus' words and make small changes to align with his message.

Now I live in Chicago, IL, but the vision is seared upon my heart for city-wide transformation. A vision for the transformation of human relational networks through regular encounters with Jesus in local communities that listen to his words and do what he says.

## How might this happen?

Since Tempe, I've prayed and pondered how this vision might be realized in Chicago. From personal experimentation and study of the early Christian communities, a few points have stood out to me.

# Transformation Tenets || Tenents of Community Transformation

## Jesus is the focal point of all transformation.

It is only from hearing Jesus and doing what he says that people are transformed.

## Transformation is ignited and fueled by fervent prayer.

Revival is a synonym for corporate transformation, and every revival was preceded by uncommon and fervent prayer.

## Transformation begins and is sustained with human relationships.

Private devotion is essential for a deepening love for Jesus and others, but transformation rarely begins in private. Almost always, people begin the path to change by what they see and hear from people in their immediate relational networks and persevere with the coaching and support of their companions.

## Transformation happens via discovery.

Humans hold truth at a distance when it's transferred by an authority figure. At the most generous, instruction from an authority figure may be accepted as truth but not acted upon. At worst, truth is rejected because of the speaker. When humans discover truth for themselves, from the source, they are compelled to act.

## Transformation happens after obedience.

Much of what Jesus teaches cannot be digested without an attempt to do it, and an attempt to do what he says results in more transformation than weeks of instruction can ever hope to achieve.

## Everyone is eligible for transformation.

Anyone who is open, no matter how slight, to hearing from God will be transformed by him. No behavior, beliefs, or background disqualifies a person. One doesn't need to believe the Bible is authoritative, that Jesus is God, or any other doctrine in Christian tradition to hear Jesus, try out what he teaches, and discover for themselves if his way is life.

# Community Discipleship Tenets

Building from the tenets, what foundation does community discipleship require to produce transformation?

## Invitation where people are.

Not only in a figurative sense, but literally where they live, work and play. It is non-essential that transformation begins in a church context, but not that people are invited. But also in the figurative sense, that no requirements be laid upon those invited except to listen to Jesus and attempt what he says.

## Attempted obedience from day one.

Obedience is the wrong word, but I don't have another right now.

## Invitation only to what people have discovered.

If transformation rises from discovered truth embedded in people's hearts, not from external authority figures, then it's only possible to be transformed as far as one has discovered.

## Invitation to a life together.

## Communities need facilitators, not leaders.

## Uncommon prayer is essential.

# Barriers to Community Discipleship

From the transformation tenets we can infer barriers. For example, if the invitation to discipleship is only for what a person has discovered, then laying requirements beyond what a person has learned from Jesus adds an unnecessary burden.
