I’ve been self-hosting my blog for nearly six months, and it’s become such a fun outlet that I want to be sure I could replicate it were something to happen. The source code is easy to store with tools like git, but I’ve felt increasingly uncertain that I’ll remember all my server configurations if I needed to deploy my site to a fresh box. At last, a real-world reason to learn an infrastructure-as-code tool!

There are numerous options - Puppet, Chef, Terraform, Ansible - and not all of them fit my use-case, but in the end, I chose Ansible because it was a Python executable which meant I could use one of my favorite dev tools, virtualenv, to ensure a siloed, reproducible Ansible deployment setup. I love sandbox tools like docker and virtualenv because I never know what OS I’ll be running next. Also, I didn’t want to shift the config complexity from my webserver to my deployment infrastructure.

From my first successful deployment, I’ve been extremely satisfied with Ansible. The module documentation is clear, the roles run fast enough, and it’s [idempotent](https://www.wordnik.com/words/idempotent). But most importantly, it meets my need to have complete documentation for every configuration on my webserver. But let me stop gushing about it and show you some examples!

My first foray into the Ansible documentation led me to think that learning adhoc commands would be a good start, then playbooks, and finally roles. After a bit of tinkering; however, I realized that roles were conceptually simpler and fit the mental model I wanted - a description of various responsibilities a server might provide. For example, a server might offer web services, and an Ansible role should describe all the steps to convert any server into a webserver. An unexpected side effect of this mental model is that it's led me to maintain functional distinctions that could be deployed to separate machines, even though at the moment it all resides on a single machine.

> Caveat: I'm going to choose a role I developed a few steps after the first. It's easier to describe and thus a better candidate for an example.

After I'd established the bedrock roles I wanted for the webserver that's hosting this site, I began to ponder what it'd take to automate the static site deployment. I'd read that others used Netlify tools to automate their site deployment so that they could add content without manually executing the commit-build-deploy steps. I didn't want to move to Netlify today, so I needed a way to achieve what Netlify does on my own.

The crux of the automation lies in responding to Github webhooks. If I automate the creation of new content to my Github repository, I need to receive a notification that the git push has occurred so that I can pull down the latest code, build, and deploy. I played with writing my server to accomplish this, but in the process, I discovered a handy package from `adnahn` called [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook). Now I have a process, the commit-build-deploy steps, and a role, the webhook server. Let's take a look at the Ansible tasks!

The first step was simple; the webhook package should be installed on the machine.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: installs webhook server
  apt:
    name: webhook
    state: latest
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

> you'll notice many tasks end with `become: yes`. This line indicates that the command requires heightened privileges to run.

Somehow, the package doesn't create it's own /etc folder, so I take that step myself.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: creates and sets hooks directory permissions
  file:
    path: /etc/webhook
    state: directory
    owner: root
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

Why did I need an /etc folder? To put my hook configuration in, of course! This copies the file from my machine to my target.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: adds hooks.json
  template:
    src: hooks.json
    dest: /etc/webhook/hooks.json
    owner: root
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

The webhook project responds to incoming webhooks by running shell scripts. I need somewhere to store them, so I create a folder in /usr/lib.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: creates and sets scripts directory permissions
  file:
    path: /usr/lib/webhook/scripts
    state: directory
    owner: root
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

With my folder created, it's time to copy the three scripts I need for the commit-build-deploy process. This might have been wrapped into one iterative task (or compiled into a single script), but I wasn't sure at the time whether I'd want a different configuration for any of the files. In my experience, it's better to have some duplication where I'm uncertain of change than to prematurely optimize and split later.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: adds script to create a new note
  template:
    src: new-note.sh
    dest: /usr/lib/webhook/scripts/new-note.sh
    owner: root
    mode: '0744'
  become: yes

- name: adds script to pull from github
  template:
    src: git-pull.sh
    dest: /usr/lib/webhook/scripts/git-pull.sh
    owner: root
    mode: '0744'
  become: yes

- name: adds script to deploy an update
  template:
    src: git-deploy.sh
    dest: /usr/lib/webhook/scripts/git-deploy.sh
    owner: root
    mode: '0744'
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

With all the webhook installation complete, it's time to proxy the server with Nginx.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: adds nginx proxy config
  template:
    src: webhook_proxy
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/webhook_proxy
  become: yes
  notify: restart nginx

  - name: enables nginx proxy config
  file:
    src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/webhook_proxy
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/webhook_proxy
    state: link
{{< / highlight >}}

Did you catch the `notify: restart nginx` line? This refers to another task which should be executed after this completes, but only when there's been a change. It's nothing fancy.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

One last step to finish the proxy. I need to allow the webhook port through my firewall.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: allows webhook port access
  ufw:
    rule: allow
    port: '6237'
    proto: tcp
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

There seem to be as many instructions for running a Linux service as there are Linux distros. I chose to create a systemd service to manage my webhook executable, but if you have a better idea, I'd love to hear it. I particularly want something efficient, fault-tolerant, and works on Debian.

{{< highlight yml >}}
- name: adds systemd script to run webhooks
  template:
    src: webhook.service
    dest: /lib/systemd/system/webhook.service
    owner: root
    mode: '0644'
  become: yes
  notify:
    - reload daemon
    - start webhook service

- name: reload daemon
  shell:
    cmd: systemctl daemon-reload
  become: yes

- name: start webhook service
  shell:
    cmd: systemctl enable --now webhook.service
  become: yes
{{< / highlight >}}

One of my next steps is to begin these tasks with better security configurations. The webhook server should run as a non-privileged user with permission only to what it requires. A couple of tasks to create a user and group, then ownership changes where I add new files and modifications to existing directories ought to do it.

Once I feel more comfortable with the security posture, I'd like to extrapolate more of the configuration to a separate file that I can configure per execution. Wouldn't it be sweet if I could point this script at a local test Docker image? Then I could be certain that both my testing and production configuration were identical.
