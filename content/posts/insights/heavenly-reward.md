Biblical Insight: Expectation of heavenly reward makes us better workers.

There is a surprising absence of Biblical content about what people do after Jesus returns. The shocked prophets who were given glimpses were so riveted on God there's little else in their writings. In the vacuum of authoritative descriptions, the Church has artistically rendered a host of possibilities. The view most prevalent in my American experience literalizes the majestic visions of angelic praises painted on the Sistine Chapel into a sort of endless worship song above the clouds. The longer that I walk with Jesus, however, the more out of focus that vision appears before the astoundly creative, exuberant, relational God that Jesus portrays.

Jesus spoke in parables about subjects ranging from finances to the future. One of Jesus' most fascinating parables that seems to reference life before and after return is the following parable.

{{< accordion luke "Luke 19:11-27" >}}

<p>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. He said therefore,</p>

<p>“A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Engage in business until I come.’ But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’</p>

<p>When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.</p>

<p>The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’ And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’</p>

<p>And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’ And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’</p>

<p>Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take wwhat you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’ He said to him, ‘I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’</p>

<p>And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’ And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’ ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.’”</p>

Parables are, by nature, meant to convey a single point. A wise interpreter does not search for hidden meanings in every description or symbolism in every image. With that caveat in mind, what is Jesus talking about?

The first clue lies in the introductory sentence. The parable was spoken to a crowd near Jericho because 1) Jesus was near Jerusalem and 2) the crowd supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. I suspect that the first point is meant to clue the reader that Jesus' trajectory towards Jerusalem is part of the parable, or at least that he meant the parable to be shared with Jerusalem's people. The second point is less ambiguous - this parable is about the appearance of God's kingdom.

Anchored in the context of this parable, that the audience is first century Jews in Jericho and Jerusalem and that the subject is the appearance of God's kingdom, what principles might we infer about life before and after Jesus' return?

- Those who remain are given resources. Each servant received one mina, or a day's wage.
- Those who remain are given authority to use their resources to turn a profit. The servants are ordered to "Engage in business until I come."
- The king expects a profit. The king's first business was to learn what his servants had done with his minas.
- The profit belongs to the king. All servants agree that the mina given is the king's, not their own.

To summarize these points,

**Everyone is given resources and authority to labor for the king's profit today. When the king returns, he grants more authority to those who turn a profit.**

Whether you're literally employeed in the business sector or conduct other productive work, there is a link between what's gained today and the authority given by the king tomorrow.

So long as employers and employees view their work as limited to this brief sphere, with a vague notion of judgment and
reward, they will ever consider spiritual investment at odds with business investment. If reward is chiefly through
Î÷spiritualÎé÷tivities, business people must forgo any hope of eternal reward, for certainly the most spiritual-the
pastors, monks and missionaries-will far outweigh their meager reward at the last day. With sullenness caused by the
age-old dichotomy that they chose to do good on earth instead of heaven, they will march on with no hope of everlasting
advancement or value for all their hard work past the grave.

Instead let us consider ourselves to receive wages from the Lord now, who takes note of our performance, gives feedback
on our efforts, and will at last promote us in proportion to the way we lived upon the earth. A company whose members
look for their reward from God will endure greater challenges and labor more free of earthly greed than those whoÎé÷ope
for reward is only in this life.

When I imagined heaven growing up, it was the typical view. Sit on a cloud, sing songs to God. Not very exciting, and
certainly not connected to anything I was doing on earth, or that I wanted to do on earth. It was C.S. LewisÎé÷scription
of heaven in his last chronicle, The Last Battle that jolted my expectation about what heaven might be like. In
LewisÎé÷le, there is little different about the setting - in fact the characters arenÎé÷mmediately aware
anythingÎé÷hanged. But they change, and this constitutes the great joy (Lewis).

As a business owner I want to remember the links between earthly and heavenly life and the hope of reward at JesusÎé÷nd.
And I want my employees to consider these things as well. I am also conscious that both myself and they will need
reminders of grace to offset the encouragement of reward, but will leave that for futher discussion.
