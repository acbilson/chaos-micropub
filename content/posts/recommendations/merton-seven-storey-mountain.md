It's an uncomfortable, wonderful experience to read an author who views the world in stark contrast to my perspective. That's been my experience with _The Seven Storey Mountain_ by Thomas Merton.

There's much to discover in Merton's autobiography. I hadn't realized that Dante's _Inferno_, from which Merton took his book's title, doesn't end with the circles of hell, but with a climb up purgatory. I also learned the names of prayer times; for example, nighttime prayer is called Compline (pronounced complin). But the best was Merton's humble ability to communicate his thoughts and feelings as a young man when he wrote his book later in life.

How difficult it is to remember the emotions; the fears and the passions of my youth! Merton exhibits astonishing insight and humility by writing his early life with such genuine veracity that I could not distinguish whether he held a conviction as a writer or only at the age he was in the timeline. He never hedges his true beliefs at a young age, even if they were ludicrous or half-formed, nor does he apologize for them.

I had not realized the book was an autobiography when I purchased it. Nor that I would find his description of the daily office so compelling that I would begin to attempt a similar practice myself. It was the Holy Spirit who prompted me to read this book about fifteen years after it was recommended to me, and I am grateful for his timely direction. Definitively recommend.

A few Merton quotes that struck me:

> Indeed, the truth that many people never understand, until it is too late, is that **the more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer**, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you, in proportion to your fear of being hurt. (emphasis added, pg. 91)

> [The rebellion of the saints is] the rebellion of the lover of the living God, the rebellion of one whose desire of God was so intense and irresistible that it condemned, with all its might, all the hypocrisy and petty sensuality and skepticism and materialism which cold and trivial minds set up as unpassable barriers between God and the souls of men. (pg. 96)

> I think that if there is one truth that people need to learn, in the world, especially today, it is this: **the intellect is only theoretically independent of desire and appetite** in ordinary, actual practice. It is constantly being blinded and perverted by the ends and aims of passion, and the evidence it presents to us with such a show of impartiality and objectivity is fraught with interest and propaganda. (pg. 234)

> if Adam had never fallen, the whole human race would have been a series of magnificently different and splendid images of God, each one of all the millions of men showing forth His glories and perfections in an astonishing new way, and each one shining with his own particular sanctity, a sanctity destined for him from all eternity as the most complete and unimaginable supernatural perfection of his human personality. If, since the fall, this plan will never be realized in millions of souls, and millions will frustrate that glorious destiny of theirs, and hide their personality in an eternal corruption of disfigurement, nevertheless, in re-forming His image in souls distorted and half destroyed by evil and disorder, God makes the works of His wisdom and love all the more strikingly beautiful by reason of the contrast with the surroundings in which He does not disdain to operate. (pg. 387)

> This means, in practice, that there is only one vocation. Whether you teach or live in the cloister or nurse the sick, whether you are in religion or out of it, married or single, no matter who you are or what you are, you are called to the summit of perfection: **you are called to a deep interior life perhaps even to mystical prayer, and to pass the fruits of your contemplation on to others**. And if you cannot do so by word, then by example. (pg. 458)
