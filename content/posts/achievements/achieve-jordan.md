TODO: Revise to be more directly related to consulting and more explanation of the circumstances.

I wanted to equip the Jordan team with solid preparation, on-field support, and a smooth re-entry so that they would be effective, unified, and ready to move forward.  I’d never been in the situation they would experience nor would I be present with them.  Also, I didn’t have sufficient man-power to receive them back well.  I decided to participate in all their meetings to remain connected to their needs.  I spent time each day praying for individual members and taking action to meet their needs.  Also I was able to answer detailed travel questions having co-planned the previous year’s trip.  During this time I developed a plan to connect each team member’s friends and family into a single network that could be updated daily on prayer requests and encouragement needs in Jordan.  I used a combination of email and SMS to keep the eighteen support members updated daily.  Also, I enlisted the help of three friends and connected with a professional counselor for the team’s return, so that we could meet individually with many of them.  The team left with confidence and all the details they needed for the trip met.  For twelve consecutive days I sent SMS and email to all the team’s supporters, cataloging the team’s daily experiences and present needs in understandable and security-wise language.  When they returned I and my friends met one-on-one with some of them, and I scheduled two meetings with the professional counselor.  Every one reported that the trip was a success; one couple has already moved overseas, one woman and another couple are making their final preparations.
