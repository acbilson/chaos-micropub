My wife and I share a grocery list so that either of us could pick up the week’s groceries. For common items, we get into a routine: pick up milk, bread, eggs. But when our needs deviate and we need a specific type of bread or a specific brand of cornbread, there’s a lot more information needed to choose the correct items. For instance, we need to specify the store where the item is sold, what brand, what type, and what quantity.

Software engineer that I am, I got to thinking about whether I could use machine learning to help accomplish more complex grocery shopping.
