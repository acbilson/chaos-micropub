TODO: turn the language to highlight project management skill

I wanted to visit India with my fiancée and plan our wedding during our five month engagement.  The timeline was tight, most resources were designed to span a year of wedding planning, she would be out of the country for a month, and the location was in another state at a place we’d never been.  First, we planned out our trip to India.  We organized the trip with our host and defined our expectations in detail.  We budgeted for ten days including travel and purchased our tickets.  Meanwhile, we selected a number of close friends, some nearby and others on-site, to assist us with the wedding planning.  I treated the opportunity as a project, creating a custom spreadsheet to track time, budget and tasks.  We met daily to discuss and refine our vision for the wedding, decide upon details and adjust for changes.  Together we carefully researched options for location, timeline, events, and more, often receiving invaluable details from our friends and family.  Our trip to India accomplished the goals for which we went.  In spite of a two week separation while my fiancée was in Jordan on the aforementioned trip, all major details of the trip were decided before leaving for India, or in three months.  Two weeks before the wedding we traveled to the site and refined the finer details of the wedding.  Tasks were defined and roles assigned to over a dozen people involved in the wedding.  The project was ready on time and within our $5,000 budget.
