The capstone of my MBA program was a six-month consulting project with a 100-page thesis. On request, I've obscured the
name of the company and its employees. I had a little fun with it and used C.S. Lewis' _Chronicles of Narnia_ as my
inspiration. Here it is!

UPDATE: I've observed that mobile browsers struggle to embed PDF files. If you're on a mobile browser and see only the first page, here's a link to download the file:
